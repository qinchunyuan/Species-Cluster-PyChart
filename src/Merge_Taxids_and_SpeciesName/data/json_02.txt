After harvesting by centrifugation, O. carboxidovorans pellets (1g) were lysed in 100 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.0, 2% Triton X-100, 2.6 mg/ml sodium azide, 8 mM PMSF by sonication on ice (4 pulses of 15 s duration each). For each condition of growth 4 samples (1g pellets) were separately treated (i.e. lysed and processed further). The supernatants were treated with 50% cold TCA, and the precipitated protein washed with acetone. The pellets were resuspended in solubilization buffer (7M urea, 20 mM tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl2, 4% CHAPS), and protein concentration was determined using the Plus One 2-D Quant Kit (Amersham) following the manufacturers instructions. Protein samples from each treatment were stored at -80 C.        One hundred micrograms of each protein sample was resuspended in 0.1 M ammonium bicarbonate, 5% HPLC grade ACN, reduced in 5 mM DTT (65 C, 5 min), alkylated in 10 mM iodoacetamide (30 C, 30 min), and then trypsin digested until there was no visible pellet (1:50 w/w 37 C, 16 h). Peptides were desalted using a peptide microtrap (Michrom BioResources, Auburn, CA) and eluted using a 0.1% TFA, 95% ACN solution. Desalted peptides were dried in a vacuum centrifuge and resuspended in 20 ?l of 0.1% formic acid.  Peptides were separated by strong cation exchange (SCX) liquid chromatography (LC) followed by reverse phase (RP) LC coupled directly in line with electrospray ionization (ESI) tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). 2DLC ESI MS/MS was done exactly as described (1). All searches were done using TurboSEQUEST (Bioworks Browser 3.2; Thermo Electron). Mass spectra and tandem mass spectra were searched against all annotated proteins from the strain OM5 including all the annotated plasmid-encoded proteins.

In this report we studied changes in protein expression in one osmotically stressed elite clone widely used in industrial plantations in Spain. High molecular weight polyethylene glycol (PEG) was used as an osmoticum in the growing medium. Roots of rooted cuttings were sampled after 3 and 36 hours of treatment. Water potential and abscissic acid content were measured in shoot and root apices to characterize the physiological states of the plants. Total soluble proteins from roots were extracted and separated using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE). Gels were stained with Coomassie brillant blue for quantitative analysis of protein accumulation. From a total of 406 reproducible spots, 34 were found to be differentially expressed depending on treatment (osmotic versus control condition) and/or stress duration (3h versus 36h), and were further characterized by tandem mass spectrometry. Several proteins were reliably identified including adenosine kinase, actin, stress-related proteins as well as proteins associated to cellular processes, among which some residents of the endoplasmic reticulum. This study constitutes the first investigation of the root proteome in this important forest tree genus.","publicationDate":"2010-10-20","submissionType":"PRIDE","numAssays":34,"species":["Eucalyptus globulus (Blue gum)"],"tissues":["root"],"ptmNames":[],"instrumentNames":["LCQ Deca","instrument model"],"projectTags":[],"doi":null,"submitter":{"title":"Dr","firstName":"Frank","lastName":"Bedon","email":"ffrraannkk77@hotmail.com","affiliation":"National Institute for Agricultural Research"},"labHeads":[],"submissionDate":"2010-05-19","reanalysis":null,"experimentTypes":["Bottom-up proteomics"],"quantificationMethods":[],"keywords":"Not available","sampleProcessingProtocol":"Not available","dataProcessingProtocol":"Not available","otherOmicsLink":null,"numProteins":2484,"numPeptides":4252,"numSpectra":4252,"numUniquePeptides":4124,"numIdentifiedSpectra":4252,"references":[{"desc":"Bedon F, Majada J, Feito I, Chaumeil P, Dupuy JW, Lomenech AM, Barre A, Gion JM, Plomion C; Interaction between environmental factors affects the accumulation of root proteins in hydroponically grown Eucalyptus globulus (Labill.)., Plant Physiol Biochem, 2011 Jan, 49, 1, 69-76, ","ids":["DOI:10.1016/j.plaphy.2010.09.020","PMID:20974537"]}]}

{"accession":"PRD000276","title":"interspecies comparison of GNA binding proteins","projectDescription":"A very common co-translational modification in multicellular organisms is the addition of carbohydrate structures called glycans to the peptide backbone. This important protein modification is called protein glycosylation. In this report, the diversity in protein glycosylation between insect species covering a wide phylogenetic distance was analyzed. Based on previous data of the glycan profile from the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster), the oligomannose N- glycan binding snowdrop lectin (Galanthus nivalis agglutinin, GNA) was selected for affinity chromatography of glycoproteins.  The insect species that were used in this study were the flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum), the silkworm (Bombyx mori), the honey bee (Apis mellifera), the fruit fly (D. melanogaster) and the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum). To identify and characterize the purified glycoproteins, LC-MS/MS analysis was performed. For all insect species, it was demonstrated that glycoproteins are involved in a broad range of biological processes and molecular functions. However, major differences between insect species were observed for particular glycosylated proteins. This finding was reflected by differences in the relative abundance of particular proteins for certain biological processes or molecular functions. Besides the abundant presence of oligomannose N-glycans on insect glycoproteins, we also showed that O-mannosylation events occur more frequently than currently anticipated.","publicationDate":"2011-03-18","submissionType":"PRIDE","numAssays":1,"species":["Tribolium castaneum (Red flour beetle)","Bombyx mori (Silk moth)","Apis mellifera (Honeybee)","Acyrthosiphon pisum (Pea aphid)","Drosophila melanogaster (Fruit fly)"],"tissues":[],"ptmNames":["2-pyrrolidone-5-carboxylic acid (Glu)","L-methionine sulfoxide","deamidated residue","N-acetylated residue"],"instrumentNames":["instrument model","Bruker Daltonics amaZon series"],"projectTags":[],"doi":null,"submitter":{"title":"Dr","firstName":"Bart","lastName":"Ghesquiere","email":"bart.ghesquiere@vib-Ugent.be","affiliation":"Biochemistry"},"labHeads":[],"submissionDate":"2010-07-08","reanalysis":null,"experimentTypes":["Bottom-up proteomics"],"quantificationMethods":[],"keywords":"Not available","sampleProcessingProtocol":"Not available","dataProcessingProtocol":"Not available","otherOmicsLink":null,"numProteins":843,"numPeptides":2964,"numSpectra":25960,"numUniquePeptides":2153,"numIdentifiedSpectra":2964,"references":[{"desc":"Vandenborre G, Smagghe G, Ghesquière B, Menschaert G, Nagender Rao R, Gevaert K, Van Damme EJ; Diversity in protein glycosylation among insect species., PLoS One, 2011 Feb 23, 6, 2, e16682, ","ids":["DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0016682","PMID:21373189"]}]}

{"accession":"PRD000394","title":"ALGOMICS","projectDescription":"Oil-bodies are sites of energy storage in many organisms including microalgae. As a first step toward understanding oil accumulation in algae, we took a proteomic approach on purified oil-body fraction from the model microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii grown under nitrogen deprivation. Among the 240 proteins (?2 peptides) identified by LC-MS/MS, 33 were putatively involved in metabolism of lipids (mostly acyl-lipids and sterols). Compared to a recently reported Chlamydomonas oil-body proteome, 19 additional proteins of lipid metabolism were identified, including a glycerol 3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT), a lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase (LPAT) and a putative phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (PDAT), spanning the key steps of the triacylglycerol synthesis pathway. In addition, proteins putatively involved in deacylation/reacylation, sterol synthesis, lipid signaling and lipid trafficking were found to be associated to the oil body fraction. This dataset thus provides evidence that in Chlamydomonas oil-bodies are not only storage compartments but also are dynamic structures likely to be involved in processes such as oil synthesis, degradation and lipid homeostasis. The proteins identified here should provide useful targets for genetic studies aiming at increasing our understanding of triacyglycerol synthesis and the role of oil-bodies in microalgal cell functions.","publicationDate":"2012-01-05","submissionType":"PRIDE","numAssays":1,"species":["Chlamydomonas reinhardtii"],"tissues":[],"ptmNames":[],"instrumentNames":["LTQ Orbitrap","instrument model"],"projectTags":[],"doi":null,"submitter":{"title":"Mr","firstName":"BAUDET","lastName":"Mathieu","email":"mathieu.baudet@cea.fr","affiliation":"Laboratoire d'Etude de la Dynamique des ProtÃ©omes"},"labHeads":[],"submissionDate":"2011-02-28","reanalysis":null,"experimentTypes":["Bottom-up proteomics"],"quantificationMethods":[],"keywords":"Not available","sampleProcessingProtocol":"Not available","dataProcessingProtocol":"Not available","otherOmicsLink":null,"numProteins":672,"numPeptides":2902,"numSpectra":2568,"numUniquePeptides":2327,"numIdentifiedSpectra":2568,"references":[{"desc":"Nguyen HM, Baudet M, Cuiné S, Adriano JM, Barthe D, Billon E, Bruley C, Beisson F, Peltier G, Ferro M, Li-Beisson Y; Proteomic profiling of oil bodies isolated from the unicellular green microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii: with focus on proteins involved in lipid metabolism., Proteomics, 2011 Nov, 11, 21, 4266-73, ","ids":["DOI:10.1002/pmic.201100114","PMID:21928291"]}]}

Moreover, physically and functionally interconnected protein complexes form functional modules involved in exosome biogenesis and functions. Specifically, we discovered that SRC signaling plays a major role in exosome biogenesis, and confirmed that inhibition of SRC kinase decreased the intracellular biogenesis and cell surface release of exosomes.

Arabidopsis leaves were sampled from challenged plants at 4, 8 and 24 hours post inoculation. Proteins were TCA-acetone-phenol extracted and subjected to 2-DE (5-8 pH range) and MS/MS (MALDI-TOF-TOF) analysis. Out of 800 matched spots on each of the 36 gels analysed, 147 spots were either absent in at least one of the conditions studied (time or treatments; qualitative variable spots) or differentially accumulated between time and treatments (quantitative variable spots). Out of the 24 proteins successfully identified over TAIR10 database, 23 have not been reported previously in similar proteomics studies of the Arabidopsis thaliana-Pseudomonas syringae interaction. The exhaustive statistical analysis performed, including principal component and heat map, showed that 24 hours post inoculation can clearly discriminate the challenged plants from the control. The protein change occurred early (4 hours post inoculation) following the virulent pathogen infection, whereas the change occurred later (24 hours post inoculation) following the avirulent pathogen inoculation. Concerning the variable proteins, three behavioural groups can be observed: group 1 (common protein changes in response to virulent and avirulent pathogen infection), group 2 (protein changes in response to virulent pathogen infection) and group 3 (protein changes in response to avirulent pathogen infection). Differential identified proteins following the pathogen infection belonged to different groups including those of oxidative stress defence, enzymes of metabolic pathways and molecular chaperones.","publicationDate":"2011-10-18","submissionType":"PRIDE","numAssays":1,"species":["Arabidopsis thaliana (Mouse-ear cress)"],"tissues":[],"ptmNames":["N6-(morpholine-2-acetyl)-lysine","iodoacetamide - site C","monohydroxylated residue"],"instrumentNames":["instrument model","4700 Proteomics Analyzer"],"projectTags":[],"doi":null,"submitter":{"title":"Dr","firstName":"Besma","lastName":"Sghaier-Hammami","email":"sghaierbesma@yahoo.fr","affiliation":"Molecular and Biochemistry "},"labHeads":[],"submissionDate":"2011-09-27","reanalysis":null,"experimentTypes":["Bottom-up proteomics"],"quantificationMethods":[],"keywords":"Not available","sampleProcessingProtocol":"Not available","dataProcessingProtocol":"Not available","otherOmicsLink":null,"numProteins":19,"numPeptides":35,"numSpectra":248,"numUniquePeptides":34,"numIdentifiedSpectra":35,"references":[]}

Mice were infected at 10e2, 10e3, or 10e4 pfu (n = 5 each) and sacrificed at 1, 2, 4, and 7 d post-infection.  Aliquots of lung proteins were combined to create two pools corresponding to early (1 and 2 d post-infection) and late (4 and 7 d post-infection) infection and each pool was then subjected to tryptic digestion, followed by strong-cation exchange fractionation, resulting in 24 fractions each. Capillary LC-MS/MS analysis was then performed on each fraction. This submission corresponds to proteomics data collected from capillary LC-MS/MS analysis of the early infection pool. The MS/MS datasets were searched with SEQUEST using no enzyme search rules, and the peptide identification results were filtered using the following cutoffs; XCorr >= 1.6, 2.4, or 3.2 for 1+, 2+, or 3+ for fully tryptic peptides, and >= 4.3 or 4.7 for 2+ or 3+ partially tryptic or non-tryptic protein terminal peptides.  Additionally, to reduce the total data size to a reasonable level, each spectrum was filtered to only include the top 100 most abundant ions in each 100 m/z-wide window. This submission is the aggregation of 24 individual LC-MS/MS analyses into one pseudo dataset.

{"accession":"PRD000666","title":"Proteomic characterization of CD56posCD57 NK cell subsets","projectDescription":"NK cells are lymphocytes that provide a first defense against viral infections and cancer. They act (i) cytotoxic by killing virus-infected and tumorigenic cells and (ii) immune regulatory by releasing cytokines and chemokines. These innate immune cells are commonly further classified as CD56bright and CD56dim NK cells. Former studies confirmed immune regulatory CD56bright NK cells as progenitors of cytotoxic CD56dim NK cells. CD57 was previously described as T cell marker for senescence and terminal differentiation. Recent studies detected CD57+ and CD57- NK cells among the CD56dim NK cell population and suggested a fully mature developmental status for CD57+ NK cells. The recent NK cell maturation model includes CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), which develop into CD56bright NK cells, later into CD56dimCD57- and finally into terminally maturated CD56dimCD57+ (1) (2) (3). The molecular mechanisms of human NK cell differentiation and maturation remain unknown to this date. We performed for the first time a proteomic analysis of these distinct developmental stages of human primary NK cells, isolated from overall 10 healthy human blood donors.  CD56bright NK cells versusCD56dim and CD56dimCD57- versus CD56dimCD57+ NK cells were analyzed by using quantitative peptide sequencing, which revealed individual protein signatures (3400 proteins) of these different NK cell developmental stages. Notably, our data support the current NK cell differentiation model by highlighting both strong distinctions between CD56dim/bright NK cells and close relationships between CD57+/- NK cells on the proteomic level. Among the most prominent and conserved regulated proteins, we detected myosin IIa, Calvasculin and Calcyclin with very similar expression patterns. We investigated their sub-cellular localization and observed specific recruitment- and accumulation-events at the NK cell immunological synapse (NKIS) after NK activation.","publicationDate":"2013-01-23","submissionType":"PRIDE","numAssays":2,"species":["Homo sapiens (Human)"],"tissues":["peripheral blood"],"ptmNames":["monohydroxylated residue","Applied Biosystems iTRAQ(TM) multiplexed quantitation chemistry","methylthiolated residue"],"instrumentNames":["LTQ Orbitrap","instrument model"],"projectTags":[],"doi":null,"submitter":{"title":"","firstName":"Lothar","lastName":"Jaensch","email":"LJA@helmholtz-hzi.de","affiliation":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"},"labHeads":[],"submissionDate":"2012-03-23","reanalysis":null,"experimentTypes":["Bottom-up proteomics"],"quantificationMethods":[],"keywords":"Not available","sampleProcessingProtocol":"Not available","dataProcessingProtocol":"Not available","otherOmicsLink":null,"numProteins":9701,"numPeptides":368460,"numSpectra":1813472,"numUniquePeptides":52869,"numIdentifiedSpectra":368460,"references":[{"desc":"Scheiter M, Lau U, van Ham M, Bulitta B, Gröbe L, Garritsen H, Klawonn F, König S, Jänsch L; Proteome analysis of distinct developmental stages of human natural killer (NK) cells., Mol Cell Proteomics, 2013 May, 12, 5, 1099-114, ","ids":["PMID:23315794","DOI:10.1074/mcp.M112.024596"]}]}

{"accession":"PRD000736","title":"Proteomic survey of the Streptomyces coelicolor nucleoid","projectDescription":"Nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs) are small, highly abundant regulators with low sequence specificity and pleiotropic mutant phenotypes. They are involved in transcriptional and post-transcriptional control of gene expression, DNA protection/repair and nucleoid structuring. Discovery of the major NAPs has been largely haphazard and based with the Enterobacteriaceae, although some Actinomycete-specific NAPs (Mdp1, Lsr2, sIHF) are known. Here, we use LC-MS/MS to systematically search for novel NAPs in isolated nucleoids of the model actinomycete Streptomyces coelicolor. Based on the criteria of high abundance (emPAI) and predicted DNA-binding ability (DNAbinder) we identified a set of around twenty proteins with a good probability of being NAPs. The approach was apparently successful as the set included known major NAPs HupA, sIHF and Lsr2 as well as the global regulators BldD and CRP. It also included a number of proteins whose functions are not yet known (SCO0204, SCO3013, SCO4232, SCO4199 and SCO1839) which provide a useful set of candidates for further study.","publicationDate":"2013-04-23","submissionType":"PRIDE","numAssays":6,"species":["Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2)"],"tissues":[],"ptmNames":["iodoacetamide - site C","monohydroxylated residue","acetylated residue"],"instrumentNames":["instrument model","LTQ Orbitrap XL"],"projectTags":[],"doi":null,"submitter":{"title":"Dr","firstName":"Gerhard","lastName":"Saalbach","email":"gerhard.saalbach@bbsrc.ac.uk","affiliation":"Biological Chemistry"},"labHeads":[],"submissionDate":"2012-07-15","reanalysis":null,"experimentTypes":["Bottom-up proteomics"],"quantificationMethods":[],"keywords":"Not available","sampleProcessingProtocol":"Not available","dataProcessingProtocol":"Not available","otherOmicsLink":null,"numProteins":2469,"numPeptides":12067,"numSpectra":118497,"numUniquePeptides":7204,"numIdentifiedSpectra":12067,"references":[{"desc":"Bradshaw E, Saalbach G, McArthur M; Proteomic survey of the Streptomyces coelicolor nucleoid., J Proteomics, 2013 May 27, 83, 37-46, ","ids":["PMID:23523638","DOI:10.1016/j.jprot.2013.02.033"]}]}

{"accession":"PXD000004","title":"Identification and quantification of human postmortem frontal cortex proteome with a SILAM mouse brain standard","projectDescription":"Prefrontal cortex tissue slices from a cognitively and neurpathologically normal human subject were obtained from the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) Brain Bank. 300-350 mg grey matter was homogenized in 1.5 ml solution A (0.32 M sucrose, 1mM MgCl2 and 0.1mM CaCl2) with a Teflon pestle.  ~100 ?l of the homogenate was saved, solubilized with 1% SDS and clarified by centrifugation.  To prepare the [13C6]brain ISTD, 400 mg labeled MouseExpress brain tissue (Cambridge Isotopes, MA) was homogenized in 4 ml buffer A as described above, centrifuged at 1,000 x g for 10 min to clarify, agitated on a rocker at 4�C for 30 min, and centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 20 min.  The pellet, a crude membrane fraction, was dissolved in 2 ml 20 mM Tris pH 7.4 with 1% SDS. Total protein in all preparations was quantified with the micro BCA assay (Pierce) and all solutions were supplemented with protease and phosphate inhibitor cocktails (Sigma) as well as 1 mM sodium fluoride and sodium orthovanadate (Sigma). Human cortex homogenate was mixed with the [13C6]brain ISTD (1?g/?l) at a ratio of 2:1(?g/?g) and processed for LC-MS/MS: 40 ?l preparations were heated with lithium dodecyl sulfate (LDS) (Invitrogen) buffer at 95�C for 20 min, separated on a 1.5 mm 4-12% Bis-Tris Gel (Invitrogen), cut into five fractions, chopped into ?2 mm cubes, washed in 200 ?l 50% acetonitrile (ACN) containing 25 mM NH4HCO3, reduced in 300 ?l 10 mM DTT, alkylated in 300 ?l 55 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma), and digested with 80-120 ?l trypsin (.025 ?g/?l) (Promega) overnight at 37�C, so that the amount of trypsin was 1:5 of the total protein to be digested by mass.  Peptides were recovered from gel cubes into 200 ?l 50/50 H2O/ACN with 3% formic acid by vortex-mixing and sonication for 20 min each, twice. Samples were then evaporated to a 100 ?l volume, brought to 1ml in H20 with 0.1% formic acid, desalted with Oasis� HLB cartridges (Waters), evaporated almost to completion and suspended in ~ 45?l H2O with 0.1% formic acid, and filtered with 0.22 �m Ultra free-MC filter cartridges (Millipore). LC-data dependant -MS/MS analyses were conducted on a Q Exactive (ThermoFisher Scientific) quadrupole orbi-trap hybrid instrument with an Easy nLC-II (ThermoFisher Scientific) nano-pump/autosampler.  3?l peptide sample (~ 1 ug) was loaded and resolved on a 20 cm x 75 �m proteopepII C18 packed tip column over a 90 min gradient at a flow rate of 350 nL/min, 0-35% mobile phase B (ACN, 0.1 formic acid).  A data-dependent top 10 method was used to acquire a 70,000 resolution full scan to trigger ten 17,500 resolution HCD scans.  Ions were isolated for MS/MS analysis with a 2.0 Da window on the quadrupole.  Average cycle times were 1.2 sec.  Each sample was analyzed in triplicate. Raw files from triplicate injections were searched together within Proteome Discoverer 1.3 (ThermoFisher Scientific) using SEQUEST and the human refseq. database (release 47, ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/refseq/H_sapiens/mRNA_Prot/).  Search parameters allowed trypsin to cleave after Lysine and Arginine and have 2 missed cleavages.  Precursor ion mass tolerance was set to 15 ppm and fragment ion mass tolerance was 20 mmu.

C. albicans RM1000 cells grown to mid-exponential phase were harvested by centrifugation.  The resulting supernatant was sterile-filtered and then concentrated on 10-kDcut-off filters (Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal filter units, Millipore) as described previously [31].  To analyse the wall proteome, cell walls were isolated by hot SDS-extraction.  The cell pellet obtained was used to prepare cell walls as described previously [36].  Briefly, the finely ground cell pellet was washed several times with PBS, and then subjected to breakage in a FastPrep bead beater (Savant Instruments Inc., Farmingdale, NY, USA) with glass beads (0.25-0.50 mm, 12-16 runs for 45 sec at speed 6) in the presence of a protease inhibitor cocktail.  Full breakage was controlled by light-microscopic inspection.  The pellet was washed several times with 1 M NaCl and stored overnight at 4°C.  The following day, the pellet was washed several times with MilliQ-water and then boiled four times for 10 min in SDS extraction buffer (150 mM NaCl, 2% (w/v) SDS, 100 mM Na-EDTA, 100 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8), washed with MilliQ-water and lyophilized overnight.  The resulting purified wall pellets were either stored at -80°C or directly reduced and S-alkylated [37].  2.4  Mass spectrometric analyses of cell wall proteomes and secretomes.  Lyophilized cell walls were reduced with 10 mM dithiothreitol in 100 mM NH4HCO3 (1 h at 55C).  After cooling to room temperature and centrifugation, the supernatant was discarded.  The reduced proteins were alkylated with 65 mM iodoacetamide in 100 mM NH4HCO3 for 45 min at room temperature in the dark.  The samples were quenched with 55 mM dithiothreitol in 100 mM NH4HCO3 for 5 min.  Subsequently, the samples were washed six times with 50 mM NH4HCO3 and either frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80C or digested using 2 µg Trypsin Gold (Promega, Madison,WI) from a 1 µg/µl stock solution for 18 h at 37°C.  The concentrated secretome samples were treated similarly, with reduction and alkylation on 10-kD cut-off spin filters (Amicon, Billerica, MA) [32]. The resulting tryptic digests were desalted using a C18 tip column (Varian, Palo Alto, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After evaporation of acetonitrile with a Speedvac (Genevac, Ipswich, England) the peptide concentration was determined at 205 nm using a NanoDrop ND-1000 (Isogen Life science, IJsselstein, The Netherlands) [38].  Each sample was diluted with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid to a final concentration of 25 ng/µl, and 10 µl per run were injected onto an Ultimate 2000 nano-HPLC system (LC Packings, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) equipped with a PepMap100 C18 reversed phase column (75 µm inner diameter, 25 cm length; Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA).  An elution flow rate of 0.3 µl/min was used along a linear gradient with increasing acetonitrile concentration over 45 min.  The eluting peptides were directly ionized by electrospray in a Q-TOF (Micromass, Whyttenshawe, UK).  Survey scans were acquired from m/z 350-1200. For low energy collision-induced dissociation (MS/MS), the most intense ions were selected in a data-dependent mode.  2.5  Data processing and analysis.  After processing with the MaxEnt3 algorithm (MasslynxProteinlynx), the spectra were converted into pkl (peak list) files (available on PRIDE: www.ebi.ac.uk/pride: accession numbers 22716-22721) .  Proteins were identified using MASCOT server 2.3.02 (Matrix Science, UK) and a database (6210 entries) consisting of a complete ORF translation of C. albicans and a list of regularly encountered contaminants. Enzyme was set to trypsin and allowing two miscleavages were allowed. Carbamidomethyl (C) was used as a fixed modification and Oxidation (M) as a variable modification. Mass tolerance and MS/MS tolerance were set to  and a tolerance of 0.3 Da0.5 Da. Detected masses were charge deconvoluted to +1.  Based on probabilistic MASCOT scoring a P value of < 0.05 was considered significant for peptide identification.

Dysfunction of WAT cells is associated with obesity associated disorders like type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Resveratrol (RSV) a natural polyphenolic compound mimics beneficial effects of calorie restriction. As such, RSV seems a promising therapeutic target for obesity-associated disorders. The effect of RSV on the human adipokine profile is still elusive. Therefore, a proteomic study together with bioinformatical analysis was performed to investigate the effect of RSV on the secretion profile of mature human Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome (SGBS) adipocytes. RSV incubation resulted in elevated basal glycerol release and reduced intracellular TG content. This increased intracellular lipolysis was accompanied by profound changes in the adipocyte secretion profile. Extracellular matrix proteins were down-regulated while processing proteins were mostly up-regulated after RSV treatment. Interestingly, RSV induced secretion of proteins protective against cellular stress and proteins involved in the regulation of apoptosis. Furthermore, we found a RSV-induced up-regulation of adiponectin and ApoE accompanied by a down-regulation of PAI-1 and PEDF secretion which may improve anti-inflammatory processes and increased insulin sensitivity. These effects are beneficial to alleviate obesity-induced metabolic complications. In addition, two novel RSV-regulated adipocyte-secreted proteins were identified.","publicationDate":"2012-08-30","submissionType":"COMPLETE","numAssays":1,"species":["Homo sapiens (Human)"],"tissues":[],"ptmNames":["iodoacetamide - site C","monohydroxylated residue"],"instrumentNames":["instrument model"],"projectTags":[],"doi":"10.6019/PXD000012","submitter":{"title":"","firstName":"Jean-Paul","lastName":"Noben","email":"jeanpaul.noben@uhasselt.be","affiliation":"FBI"},"labHeads":[],"submissionDate":"2012-08-02","reanalysis":null,"experimentTypes":["Bottom-up proteomics"],"quantificationMethods":[],"keywords":"human adipocytes, RSV, adipokines, lipolysis, 2-DE LC-MS/MS","sampleProcessingProtocol":"Not available","dataProcessingProtocol":"Not available","otherOmicsLink":"PPV000003","numProteins":72,"numPeptides":424,"numSpectra":580,"numUniquePeptides":221,"numIdentifiedSpectra":424,"references":[{"desc":"Rosenow A, Noben JP, Jocken J, Kallendrusch S, Fischer-Posovszky P, Mariman EC, Renes J; Resveratrol-induced changes of the human adipocyte secretion profile., J Proteome Res, 2012 Sep 7, 11, 9, 4733-43, ","ids":["DOI:10.1021/pr300539b","PMID:22905912"]}]}

{"accession":"PXD000016","title":"Physiological adaptation of the Rhodococcus jostii RHA1 membrane proteome to steroids as growth substrates","projectDescription":"Rhodococcus jostii RHA1 is a catabolically versatile soil actinomycete that can utilize a wide range of organic compounds as growth substrates including steroids. To globally assess the adaptation of the protein composition in the membrane fraction to steroids, the membrane proteomes of RHA1 grown on each of cholesterol and cholate were compared to pyruvate-grown cells using gel-free SIMPLE-MudPIT technology. Label-free quantification by spectral counting revealed 59 significantly regulated proteins, many of them present only during growth on steroids. Cholesterol and cholate induced distinct sets of steroid-degrading enzymes encoded by paralogous gene clusters, consistent with transcriptomic studies. CamM and CamABCD, two systems that take up cholate metabolites, were found exclusively in cholate-grown cells. Similarly, 9 of the 10 Mce4 proteins of the cholesterol uptake system were found uniquely in cholesterol-grown cells. Bioinformatic tools were used to construct a model of Mce4 transporter within the RHA1 cell envelope. Finally, comparison of the membrane and cytoplasm proteomes indicated that several steroid-degrading enzymes are membrane-associated. The implications for the degradation of steroids by actinomycetes, including cholesterol by the pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis , are discussed. Bioinformatics and data processing: All database searches were performed using SEQUEST algorithm, embedded in BioworksTM (Rev. 3.3.1, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA), with a RHA1 database containing 9145 sequences. Only tryptic peptides with up to two missed cleavages were accepted. No fixed modifications were considered. Oxidation of methionine was permitted as variable modification. The mass tolerance for precursor ions was set to 10 ppm; the mass tolerance for fragment ions was set to 1 amu. For protein identification a threshold for deltaCn (0.08) and for XCorr values was defined, depending on the peptide charge (>2.5 (+2); > 3.5 (+3)). A protein was considered identified if at least two different peptides met these criteria. To assess the false discovery rate (FDR) of protein identification, a database with reversed protein sequences was searched retaining the search parameters and filter criteria. The FDR was calculated by dividing the absolute number of hits from the reversed database through the sum of hits from both database searches (reversed database and original database). Using the stringent criteria described above, no reversed database hit was found; therefore, the FDR was 0% in all measurements. This low error rate can be attributed to the additional demand for two different peptide matches per protein, which eliminated all otherwise observed protein hits against the decoy database.","publicationDate":"2013-03-06","submissionType":"COMPLETE","numAssays":24,"species":["Rhodococcus sp.

{"accession":"PXD000030","title":"Annexin A1 interacting proteins in chronic myeloid leukemia KCL22 cells","projectDescription":"In the present study, we used a functional proteomic approach to identify Annexin A1 (Anxa1) interacting proteins in the Philadelphia-positive KCL22 cell line. We focused on Anxa1 because it is one of the major proteins upregulated in imatinib-sensitive KCL22S cells versus imatinib-resistant KCL22R. Our proteomic strategy revealed 21 interactors. Bioinformatic analysis showed that most of these proteins are involved in cell death processes. Among the proteins identified, we studied the interaction of Anxa1 with two phosphatases, Shp1 and Shp2, which were recently identified as biomarkers of imatinib sensitivity in patients affected by chronic myeloid leukemia. Our data open new perspectives in the search for annexin-mediated signaling pathways and may shed light on mechanisms of resistance to imatinib that are unrelated to Bcr-Abl activity. For data analysis, we used the MASCOT software (version 2.4) Peptide Mass Fingerprinting search program (http://www.matrixscience.com) selecting NCBInr aug2010 database (11592891 sequences) (http://www.ncbi. nlm.nih.gov), and the following six parameters: specificity of the proteolytic enzyme used for hydrolysis (trypsin); up to 1 missed cleavage; cysteines such as S-carbamidomethylcysteines; unmodified N- and C-terminal ends; unmodified and oxidized methionines; putative Gln-induced pyroGlu formation; a precursor peptide maximum mass tolerance of 400 ppm, and a maximum fragment mass tolerance of 0.6 Da.

Thermal acclimation drastically alters thermotolerance of ectotherms, but the mechanisms determining this plastic response are not fully understood. The present study investigates the proteomic response (2D-DIGE) of adult Drosophila melanogaster acclimated at 11, 25 or 31 °C. As expected 11 °C-acclimation improved cold tolerance and 31 °C-acclimation improved heat tolerance. We hypothesized that the marked organismal responses to acclimation could be detected at the proteomic level assuming that changes in the abundance of specific proteins are linked to the physiological changes underlying the phenotypic response. The 31 °C-acclimated flies displayed a particular divergent proteomic profile where molecular chaperones made up a large number of the proteins that were modulated during heat acclimation. Many other proteins showed significant modulation during acclimation including proteins involved in iron ion and cell redox homeostasis, carbohydrate and energy metabolism, chromatin remodeling and translation, and contractile machinery. Interestingly the changes in protein abundance were often unrelated to transcriptional activity of the genes coding for the proteins, except for the most strongly expressed proteins (e.g. Hsp70). The 11 °C-acclimation evoked weak proteomic response despite the marked effect on the organismal phenotype. Thus the acquired cold tolerance observed here may involve regulatory process such as posttranslational regulation rather than de novo protein synthesis. Bioinformatics and data processing: The proteinScape 2.1 software (BrukerDaltonik GmbH) was used to submit MS/MS data to the following database: NCBI restricted to Drosophila (June 2011, 223,543 sequences) using the Mascot search engine (Mascot server v2.2, http://www.matrixscience.com). Parameters were set as follows: trypsin as enzyme with one allowed miscleavage, carbamidomethylation of cysteins as fixed modification and methionine oxidation as variable modifications. The mass tolerance for parent and fragment ions was set to 0.5 Da. Peptide identifications were accepted if the individual ion Mascot scores were above the identity threshold (the ion score is −10*log(P), where P is the probability that the observed match is a random event, P < 0.05). In case of ambiguous assignments (one compound fit to more than one peptide), peptide were accepted based on the peptide score, meaning that the peptide sequence with the highest score is accepted. The compilation of identified peptides to proteins was performed with the ProteinExtractor algorithm (Thiele et al., 2008, 2010), so that every protein reported was identified by at least one peptide with significant ion Mascot score (above the identity threshold).","publicationDate":"2013-03-04","submissionType":"COMPLETE","numAssays":50,"species":["Drosophila (fruit flies)"],"tissues":[],"ptmNames":["iodoacetamide derivatized residue","monohydroxylated residue"],"instrumentNames":["Bruker Daltonics HCT Series","instrument model"],"projectTags":[],"doi":"10.6019/PXD000043","submitter":{"title":"Dr","firstName":"E","lastName":"Com","email":"emmanuelle.com@univ-rennes1.fr","affiliation":"Protim, Irset, Inserm U1085"},"labHeads":[],"submissionDate":"2012-09-27","reanalysis":null,"experimentTypes":["Bottom-up proteomics"],"quantificationMethods":[],"keywords":"proteomics, acclimation, thermotolerance, fruit fly","sampleProcessingProtocol":"Not available","dataProcessingProtocol":"Not available","otherOmicsLink":null,"numProteins":313,"numPeptides":2763,"numSpectra":76025,"numUniquePeptides":1099,"numIdentifiedSpectra":1499,"references":[{"desc":"Colinet H, Overgaard J, Com E, Sørensen JG; Proteomic profiling of thermal acclimation in Drosophila melanogaster., Insect Biochem Mol Biol, 2013 Apr, 43, 4, 352-65, ","ids":["PMID:23416132","DOI:10.1016/j.ibmb.2013.01.006"]}]}

{"accession":"PXD000047","title":"Endogenous Purification Reveals GREB1 as a Key Estrogen Receptor Regulatory Factor","projectDescription":"Estrogen receptor-alpha (ER) is the driving transcription factor in most breast cancers, and its associated proteins can influence drug response, but direct methods for identifying interacting proteins have been limited. We purified endogenous ER using an approach termed RIME (rapid immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry of endogenous proteins) and discovered the interactome under agonist- and antagonist-liganded conditions in breast cancer cells, revealing transcriptional networks in breast cancer. The most estrogen-enriched ER interactor is GREB1, a potential clinical biomarker with no known function. GREB1 is shown to be a chromatin-bound ER coactivator and is essential for ER-mediated transcription, because it stabilizes interactions between ER and additional cofactors. We show a GREB1-ER interaction in three xenograft tumors, and using a directed protein-protein approach, we find GREB1-ER interactions in half of ER+ primary breast cancers. This finding is supported by histological expression of GREB1, which shows that GREB1 is expressed in half of ER+ cancers, and predicts good clinical outcome. These findings reveal an unexpected role for GREB1 as an estrogen-specific ER cofactor that is expressed in drug-sensitive contexts.

Searches were done with tryptic specificity allowing up to one miscleavage and a tolerance on mass measurement of 10 ppm in MS mode and 0.6 Da for MS/MS ions. Structure modifications allowed were oxidized methionine, and deamidation of asparagine and glutamine residues, which were searched as variable modifications. Using a reversed decoy database, false discovery rate (FDR) was less than 1%. Detailed results including peptide sequences, peptide scores, ion scores, expect values, and Mascot scores have been included in Table S1. SILAC data were analyzed using Proteome Discoverer v.1.3. This analysis only uses unique peptides for ratio analysis. The resulting fold-change ratios for proteins found in both replicates were then converted into log fold-change ratios as represented in the figures. In a few instances where protein ratios were absent due to signal from only one of the two channels, these were ranked highest in the log fold-change table following manual inspection of the raw data (MS and MS/MS) to confirm specificity to a single label.","publicationDate":"2013-08-08","submissionType":"COMPLETE","numAssays":11,"species":["Homo sapiens (Human)"],"tissues":[],"ptmNames":["monohydroxylated residue","deamidated residue"],"instrumentNames":["LTQ Orbitrap","instrument model"],"projectTags":[],"doi":"10.6019/PXD000047","submitter":{"title":"Mr","firstName":"Hisham","lastName":"Mohammed","email":"hisham.mohammed@cancer.org.uk","affiliation":"Oncology"},"labHeads":[],"submissionDate":"2012-10-04","reanalysis":null,"experimentTypes":["Bottom-up proteomics"],"quantificationMethods":[],"keywords":"RIME","sampleProcessingProtocol":"Not available","dataProcessingProtocol":"Not available","otherOmicsLink":null,"numProteins":6908,"numPeptides":59771,"numSpectra":156533,"numUniquePeptides":18587,"numIdentifiedSpectra":38696,"references":[{"desc":"Mohammed H, D'Santos C, Serandour AA, Ali HR, Brown GD, Atkins A, Rueda OM, Holmes KA, Theodorou V, Robinson JL, Zwart W, Saadi A, Ross-Innes CS, Chin SF, Menon S, Stingl J, Palmieri C, Caldas C, Carroll JS; Endogenous purification reveals GREB1 as a key estrogen receptor regulatory factor., Cell Rep, 2013 Feb 21, 3, 2, 342-9, ","ids":["PMID:23403292","DOI:10.1016/j.celrep.2013.01.010"]}]}
{"accession":"PXD000050","title":"The human islet of Langerhans proteome database","projectDescription":"Type 2 diabetes is a worldwide disease reaching epidemic dimensions. The rapid progression of the disease urgently calls for both a broader and deeper understanding of its pathophysiology. In line with this statement, the Human Diabetes Proteome Project (HDPP) was officially launched at the 11th HUPO meeting in Boston, 2012. A special session was dedicated to this new initiative, gathering experts in the main topics related to diabetes and its associated complications. Key issues were debated with a focus on how deranged circulating glucose and free fatty acids induce dysfunction. It has been decided that HDPP will therefore focus on studying the early stages of diabetes that lead to abnormal glucose and lipid levels. The initiative will initially focused on islets of Langerhans, insulin-producing cell lines, and blood human samples from diabetes-related cohorts. In subsequent stages HDPP will investigate target tissues in which glucose and lipids could promote protein dysfunctions. Omics-rooted systems approaches enhanced by bioinformatics will be deployed to unravel effects of lipids and glucose triggering diabetes initiation and progression. A first milestone has been defined for the 12th HUPO meeting in Yokohama, 2013: the 1000 diabetes-associated protein (the 1000-HDPP) database, i.e. a freely available internet resource (www.HDPP.info) of more than 1000 proteins with links to their corresponding proteotypic peptides, affinity reagents and protein-specific biological/biomedical information.

Data are from labella of mature, unpollinated flowers of (1) Ophrys exaltata subsp. archipelagi, (2) O. sphegodes, and (3) O. garganica. Proteomics data were searched against SwissProt and TAIR databases and further against organism-specific databases obtained from transcriptome sequencing (454, Sanger ESTs and Solexa data). Thirteen trypsinised gel slices per sample were subjected to electrospray ionisation-based LC-MS/MS analysis with a 2D linear ion trap Finnigan LTQ (Thermo Electron Corporation) equipped with an Ultimate Nano HPLC System (Dionex Corporation). Mass spectra were searched against SwissProt and Arabidopsis TAIR9 protein databases to identify peptides. Additionally, spectra were searched against protein databases created from the Ophrys reference transcriptome obtained in this study. Stringent criteria were used for the assignment of spectra to peptides (95% peptide identification probability) in Scaffold 3.3 (Proteome Software Inc., USA). In order to maximise the utility of proteomics data for uncovering proteins predicted by the orchid transcriptome, a minimum of one unique peptide was used for protein identification, while using two different stringency levels for the probabilistic assignment of peptides to proteins (99% for highest quality, HQ; 90% to maximise protein discovery, PD, in the absence of a fully sequenced genome).

We cultivated this microorganism in three NaCl concentrations, i.e. optimal (0.5%), without (0.0%) and high (4.0%) salt concentration, and analyzed its cellular proteome. For assigning tandem mass spectrometry data, we first sequenced its genome and constructed a six reading frame ORF database from the draft sequence. We annotated only the genes whose products (872) were detected. We compared the quantitative proteome data sets recorded for the three different growth conditions.Peak lists were generated with the MASCOT DAEMON software (version 2.3.2) from Matrix Science using the extract_msn.exe data import filter from the Xcalibur FT package (version 2.0.7) proposed by ThermoFisher. Data import filter options were set at 400 (minimum mass), 5,000 (maximum mass), 0 (grouping tolerance), 0 (intermediate scans), and 1,000 (threshold). MS/MS spectra were searched against the  home-made ORF database with the following parameters: tryptic peptides with a maximum of 2 miss cleavages during proteolytic digestion, a mass tolerance of 5 ppm on the parent ion and 0.5 Da on the MS/MS, fixed modification for carbamidomethylated Cys (+57.0215) and variable modification for oxidized Met (+15.9949).  All peptide matches with a peptide score above its query threshold set at p < 0.05 with the ORF database and rank 1 were parsed using the IRMa 1.28.0 software. False-positive rate for peptide identification was estimated using a decoy database as below 0.5% with these parameters. MS/MS spectra assigned to several loci were systematically removed. A protein was considered validated when at least two different peptides were detected in the same experiment. False-positive identification of proteins was estimated using a reverse decoy database as below 0.1% with these parameters The number of MS/MS spectra per protein (spectral counts) was determined for the three replicates in each growth condition. The protein abundances were compared using the T-Fold option of the PatternLab 2.0 software. This module allows normalising the spectral count datasets, calculating the average fold changes with statistics (t-test), and estimating the resulting theoretical false discovery rate. Stringent parameters were used in this analysis: minimum fold change of 1.5, minimum p-value of 0.05 and BH-FDR Alfa of 0.15.","publicationDate":"2012-12-18","submissionType":"COMPLETE","numAssays":9,"species":["Bacteria"],"tissues":[],"ptmNames":["iodoacetamide derivatized residue","monohydroxylated residue"],"instrumentNames":["LTQ Orbitrap","instrument model"],"projectTags":[],"doi":"10.6019/PXD000094","submitter":{"title":"Dr","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"ARMENGAUD","email":"jean.armengaud@cea.fr","affiliation":"Li2D"},"labHeads":[],"submissionDate":"2012-12-11","reanalysis":null,"experimentTypes":["Bottom-up proteomics"],"quantificationMethods":[],"keywords":"Proteogenomics, Draft genome, Halotolerance, Alphaproteobacteria, Rhodospirillaceae","sampleProcessingProtocol":"Not available","dataProcessingProtocol":"Not available","otherOmicsLink":null,"numProteins":8169,"numPeptides":83338,"numSpectra":80931,"numUniquePeptides":29834,"numIdentifiedSpectra":80931,"references":[{"desc":"Rubiano-Labrador C, Bland C, Miotello G, Guérin P, Pible O, Baena S, Armengaud J.

Previous MALDI-TOF analysis of DivIVA showed that a large 7.2 kDa tryptic peptide was multiply phosphorylated. To aid localization of the phosphorylation sites, additional tryptic cleavage sites were introduced into DivIVA and the resulting phosphopeptides were analysed by LC-MS/MS. Phosphopeptide isomers could be separated chromatographically, but because of overlapping elution and spectrum quality, site assignment by standard software tools was ambiguous. Because fragment ions carrying the phosphate group are essential for confident localization, large numbers of spectra were collected using targeted LC-MS/MS and a special script was developed for plotting the elution of site-determining fragments from those spectra under the XIC of the parent ions. Where multiple phosphopeptide isomers were present, the elution of the site-determining y-ions perfectly coincided with the elution of the corresponding phosphopeptide isomer. This method represents a useful tool for user inspection of spectra derived from phosphopeptide isomers,  and significantly increases confidence when defining phosphorylation sites. In this way, we show that DivIVA is phosphorylated in vivo on 5 sites in the C-terminal part of the protein (T304, S309, S338, S344 and S355).","publicationDate":"2013-08-04","submissionType":"COMPLETE","numAssays":3,"species":["Streptomyces coelicolor"],"tissues":[],"ptmNames":["iodoacetamide derivatized residue","phosphorylated residue","monohydroxylated residue"],"instrumentNames":["LTQ Orbitrap","instrument model"],"projectTags":[],"doi":"10.6019/PXD000095","submitter":{"title":"Dr","firstName":"Gerhard","lastName":"Saalbach","email":"gerhard.saalbach@jic.ac.uk","affiliation":"Biological Chemistry"},"labHeads":[],"submissionDate":"2013-06-02","reanalysis":null,"experimentTypes":["Bottom-up proteomics"],"quantificationMethods":[],"keywords":"Ascore, DivIVA, phosphopeptides, phosphorylation site localization, ScaffoldPTM, targeted LC-MS/MS, Orbitrap","sampleProcessingProtocol":"Not available","dataProcessingProtocol":"Not available","otherOmicsLink":null,"numProteins":95,"numPeptides":1663,"numSpectra":12701,"numUniquePeptides":167,"numIdentifiedSpectra":1413,"references":[{"desc":"Saalbach G, Hempel AM, Vigouroux M, Flärdh K, Buttner MJ, Naldrett MJ; Determination of Phosphorylation Sites in the DivIVA Cytoskeletal Protein of Streptomyces coelicolor by Targeted LC-MS/MS., J Proteome Res, 2013 Sep 6, 12, 9, 4187-92, ","ids":["DOI:10.1021/pr400524d","PMID:23905541"]}]}

We devised a proteogenomic approach constructing a custom protein sequence search space, built from both SwissProt and RIBO-seq derived translation products, applicable for LC-MSMS spectrum identification.  To record the impact of using the constructed deep proteome database we performed two alternative MS-based proteomic strategies: (I) a regular shotgun proteomic and (II) an N-terminal COFRADIC approach. The obtained fragmentation spectra were searched against the custom database (combination of UniProtKB-SwissProt and RIBO-seq derived translation sequences) using three different search engines: OMSSA (version 2.1.9), X!Tandem (TORNADO, version 2010.01.01.04) and Mascot (version 2.3). The first two were run from the SearchGUI graphical user interface (version 1.10.4). A combination of X!Tandem and Mascot was used for the N-terminal COFRADIC analysis, a combination of all three search engines for the shotgun proteome analysis. Note that OMMSA cannot cope with the protease setting semi-ArgC/P needed to analyze N-terminal COFRADIC data.For the shotgun proteome data, trypsin was set as cleavage enzyme allowing for one missed cleavage, and singly to triply charged precursors or singly to quadruple charged precursors were taken into account respectively for the Mascot or X!Tandem/OMSSA search engines, and the precursor and fragment mass tolerance were set to respectively 10 ppm and 0.5 Da. Methionine oxidation to methionine-sulfoxide, pyroglutamate formation of N-terminal glutamine and acetylation (protein N-terminus) were set as variable modifications. For the N-terminal COFRADIC analysis the protease setting semi-ArgC/P (Arg-C specificity with arginine-proline cleavage allowed) was used. No missed cleavages were allowed and the precursor and fragment mass tolerance were also set to respectively 10 ppm and 0.5 Da.

{"accession":"PXD000127","title":"15N Limitation of detection in Pseudomonas fluorescens","projectDescription":"The limit of 15N detection in proteins of Pseudomonas putida was studied by LC-MS/MS. Cells were grown in the presence of 0.1%15N to 10% 15N.The method of protein-based stable isotope probing (protein-SIP) has previously been shown to allow the modeling of carbon fluxes in microbial communities, demonstrating its high benefit in microbial ecology. The method’s high sensitivity allows the analysis of stable isotope distribution in target molecules, revealing metabolic activities of the species present in an ecosystem. Besides carbon, an application of protein-SIP with nitrogen is of interest for resolving the nitrogen fluxes in microbial communities. Thus, the sensitivity and reliability of a protein-SIP approach employing ^15 N was analyzed. For this, cultivations of Pseudomonas fluorescens ATCC 17483 with different ratios of ^14 N:^15 N were performed, from 10 % down to 0.1 % ^15 N. After incubation leading to complete labeling of biomass, proteins were extracted and separated by one-dimensional gel electrophoresis (1-DE), followed by tryptic digest and UPLC Orbitrap MS/MS analysis. ^15 N relative isotope abundance (RIA) was calculated based on isotopic patterns from identified peptides in mass spectra. The distribution of ^15 N RIA values among peptides was analyzed in samples with different ^15 N amount, and potential causes for variations within individual samples of either technical or biological origin were investigated. Using a number of 50 peptides, significant differences in ^15 N incorporation were found down to 0.1 % RIA. The study demonstrates that protein-SIP using ^15 N is sufficiently sensitive for quantitative investigation of microbial activity in nitrogen cycling processes. Raw data were processed for database search using Thermo Proteome Discoverer software (v1.0 build 43). Search was performed by tandem mass spectrometry ion search algorithms from the Mascot house server (v2.2.1). The following parameters were selected: /Pseudomonas fluorescens/ sequences of NCBInr (NCBI, version June 2012 and later) as criterion for taxonomy, tryptic cleavage, maximal two missed cleavage sites. A peptide tolerance threshold of ± 10 ppm and an MS/MS tolerance threshold of ± 0.2 Da were chosen. Carbamidomethylation at cysteines was given as static and oxidation of methionines as variable modification. Peptide identification data from all samples were merged using Thermo® Proteome Discoverer software (v1.0 build 43, Thermo Fisher Scientific).

{"accession":"PXD000129","title":"Drosophila immune response","projectDescription":"This project aims to define, by using a functional proteomic approach, the molecular partners associated with the canonical coupound of the IMD pathway. The Drosophila defense against pathogens largely relies on the activation of two major pathways, IMD and TOLL. The IMD pathway is activated mainly by Gram-negative bacteria, whereas the TOLL pathway responds predominantly to Gram-positive bacteria and fungi. The activation of this pathway leads to the rapid induction via NF-kB of numerous genes of the immune system, including various antimicrobial peptide genes. Recent evidence indicates that the IMD pathway is also involved in various other reactions in the absence of infection (\"inflammatory-like\" reactions). To gain a better understanding of the molecular machineries underlying the pleiotropic functions of this pathway, we have developed a proteomics analysis. Our first aim was to identify the proteins interacting with the 11 canonical members (PGRP-LC, PGRP-LE, IMD, BG4 (dFADD), DREDD, TAK1, TAB2, IAP2, IRD5 (DmIKKbeta), KEY (DmIKKgamma), and RELISH) previously shown to be involved in the activation of the IMD pathway. Each protein was fused N-terminally or C-terminally with a biotin tag and was stably expressed in S2 cells previously subjected to stable integration of the bacterial enzyme BirA to allow for biotinylation of the tags. In total, we established 22 stable transformant cell lines (11 genes x 2 tag locations), which were individually stimulated by heat-killed E.coli before harvest at 4 different time points (t=0 min, 10 min, 2 hour, and 8 hour). This procedure was followed by streptavidin-mediated affinity purification of 96 bait-protein complexes (22 transformants x 4 time points, plus 8 unstimulated controls without baits), on-bead trypsin digestions of the protein complexes and six LC-MS/MS analyses. We have identified 371 interactanting proteins in heat-killed E.coli stimulated Drosophila S2 cells, 90% of which have human orthologues. Comparative analysis of Gene Ontology (GO) annotation datasets from Human and Flies point to three significant common categories: (1) NuA4 Histone acetyltransferase complex, (2) SWI/SNF-type Chromatin remodeling complex, and (3) Transcription cofactor binding. Our Drosophila data point in particular to SUMOylation of the IkB-kinase homologue Ird5 in Drosophila, a level of regulation not described to date. Among numerous directions opened by our proteomics analysis, we have decided to first investigate this facet of the IMD pathway. We show nthat a highly conserved SUMOylation consensus site binds Drosophila SUMO (SMT3) in a challenge-dependent manner and that this process confers an increased level of activation of the antimicrobial peptide genes during bacterial challenge both in vitro and in flies. Our results demonstrate that SUMOylation of IKKbeta plays an important role in the induction of antimicrobial peptide genes. The MS analysis was performed on a FT ICR mass spectrometer (LTQ-FT Ultra, ThermoFisher Scientific, San Jose, CA) with the top 7 acquisition method: MS resolution 60,000, mass range 500-2000 Th, followed by 7 MS/MS (LTQ) on the 7 most intense peaks, with a dynamic exclusion for 90 s. The raw data were processed using Xcalibur 2.0.7 software. Each sample was first analyzed in triplicate then an exclusion list was added for three next runs. The database search was done on merged data using Mascot search engine (Matrix Science Mascot 2.3) on the 17D melanogaster databank (16535 sequences). Proteome Discoverer 1.3 (ThermoFisher Scientific) and Mascot were used to search the data and filter the results.

{"accession":"PXD000152","title":"Conservation of the extended substrate specificity profiles among homologous granzymes across species","projectDescription":"Granzymes are a family of structurally related serine proteases involved in immunity. To date four out of five human granzymes have been assigned orthologues in mice; however for granzyme H, no clear murine orthologue has been suggested and its role in cytotoxicity remains controversial. In this study, we demonstrate that granzyme H is an inefficient cytotoxin. Besides analyzing the substrate specificity profile of granzyme H by means of substrate phage display, we assessed human granzyme H and mouse granzyme C cleavage susceptibility on a proteome-wide level. The extended specificity profiles of granzyme C and granzyme H (i.e. beyond P4-P4') match those previously observed for granzyme B. We demonstrate conservation of these extended specificity profiles among various granzymes since granzyme B cleavage susceptibility of an otherwise granzyme H/C specific cleavage site can be conferred simply by altering the P1-residue to aspartate, the preferred P1-residue of granzyme B. Our results thus indicate a conserved, but hitherto generally underappreciated specificity-determining role of extended protease-substrate contacts in steering cleavage susceptibility.

{"accession":"PXD000162","title":"Hypoxia-induced Changes in the Secretome of Human Preadipocytes and Adipocytes","projectDescription":"White adipose tissue (WAT) is involved in energy metabolism by secretion of proteins with endocrine and paracrine effects. Dysregulation of the secretion pattern of obesity-associated enlarged WAT may lead to obesity-related disorders. This dysregulation may be the result of a hypoxic state caused by poorly vascularised WAT. The effect of hypoxia on the secretome of human (pre)adipocytes is largely unkown. Therefore, secretome changes of CoCl2-treated and non-treated human SGBS (pre)adipocytes were studied by using 2DE with bioinformatic analysis. In addition, regulation of protein secretion was analysed by protein turnover experiments. Hypoxia-induced secretome changes were mostly associated with protein down-regulation and extracellular matrix protein dysregulation. The observed up-regulation of collagens in adipocytes may be essential for cell survival while down-regulation of collagens in preadipocytes may indicate a disturbed differentiation process. These hypoxia-induced changes can be seen as WAT dysfunction that may lead to obesity-associated complications. In addition, 9 novel adipocyte secreted proteins were identified from which 6 were regulated by hypoxia.LC ESI-MS/MS and database search: Excised spots were in-gel trypsin digested and ten microliters of the digested was analyzed by LC ESI-MS/MS on a LCQ Classic (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA).

Peak lists were searched with Sequest v1.2.0.208 and Mascot v2.3.0.1 against EMBL-EBI International Protein Index database for human proteins (version 3.78, 86 702 entries) and using following settings: fragment tolerance, 1.00 Da (monoisotopic); parent tolerance, 3.0 Da (monoisotopic); ﬁxed modiﬁcations, carbamidomethylation of cystein; variable modiﬁcations, oxidation of methionin; max missed cleavages, 2. Search engine results were combined and validated by Scaffold v3.00.07 (Proteome Software, Portland, OR) with minimum peptide and protein probability set to =80%, followed by visual inspection of spectral (annotation) quality and manual curation, eliminating high background spectra and single engine identiﬁcations, evaluating one-hit wonders and ﬁltering out keratins. Mass spectrometry data can be visualized using PRIDE Inspector and Scaffold .sf3 free viewer (https://proteomecommons.org/tool.jsp?i=1009). Maldi-MS and database search: For MALDI-TOF MS 1.5 mL of each peptide mixture and 0.5 mL matrix solution (10 mg/mL CHCA in 50% ACN/0.1% TFA) was spotted automatically onto a 96 well-format target plate. The spots were allowed to air-dry for homogeneous crystallization. Spectra were obtained using a M@LDI-LR mass spectrometer (Waters). The instrument was operated in positive reflector mode. The acquisition mass range was 900–3000 Da. The instrument was calibrated on 6–8 reference masses from a tryptic digest of alcohol dehydrogenase. In addition, a near point lockmass correction for each sample spot was performed using adrenocorticotropic hormone fragment 18–39 (MH1 2465.199) to achieve maximum mass accuracy. Typically 100 shots were combined and the background was subtracted. A peptide mass list was generated for the subsequent database search. For semi-quantitative labeling measurements, the area of the M15 peak was divided by that of the M peak x100%. A SD was obtained for this isotopomer mass peak ratio by repeating the experiment three times. Significance of differences between ratios was determined by analysis of variance. The peptide mass list was searched with ProteinLynx Global Server (Waters) or the Mascot search engine (http://www.matrixscience.com) against the Swiss-Prot database (http://expasy.ch/sprot) for protein identification. One miss-cleavage was tolerated, carbamidomethylation was set as a fixed modification and oxidation of methionine as an optional modification. The peptide mass tolerance was set to 100 ppm. No restrictions were made on the protein M and the pI. A protein was regarded as identified when it had a significant MASCOT probability score (p<0.05) and at least five peptide mass hits or sequence coverage of at least 30% of the complete protein sequence.","publicationDate":"2013-10-29","submissionType":"COMPLETE","numAssays":39,"species":["Homo sapiens (Human)"],"tissues":[],"ptmNames":["iodoacetamide derivatized residue","monohydroxylated residue"],"instrumentNames":["instrument model","4800 Proteomics Analyzer"],"projectTags":["Biomedical"],"doi":"10.6019/PXD000162","submitter":{"title":"","firstName":"Jean-Paul","lastName":"Noben","email":"jeanpaul.noben@uhasselt.be","affiliation":"FBI"},"labHeads":[],"submissionDate":"2013-02-27","reanalysis":null,"experimentTypes":["Bottom-up proteomics"],"quantificationMethods":[],"keywords":"human (pre)adipocytes,  hypoxia, secretome, turnover","sampleProcessingProtocol":"Not available","dataProcessingProtocol":"Not available","otherOmicsLink":null,"numProteins":234,"numPeptides":1226,"numSpectra":36252,"numUniquePeptides":717,"numIdentifiedSpectra":456,"references":[{"desc":"Rosenow A, Noben JP, Bouwman FG, Mariman EC, Renes J; Hypoxia-mimetic effects in the secretome of human preadipocytes and adipocytes., Biochim Biophys Acta, 2013 Dec, 1834, 12, 2761-71, ","ids":["PMID:24140569","DOI:10.1016/j.bbapap.2013.10.003"]}]}

The overall goal of the presented study was (I) to unravel bacterial community structure and function of such an uropathogenic biofilm and (II) to elucidate the interplay between bacterial virulence and the human immune system within the urine. To this end, a metaproteomics approach combined with in vitro proteomics analyses was employed to investigate both, the pro- and eukaryotic protein inventory. Our proteome analyses demonstrated that the biofilm of the investigated catheter is dominated by three bacterial species, i.e. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Morganella morganii and Bacteroides sp., and identified iron limitation as one of the major challenges in the bladder environment. In vitro proteome analysis of P. aeruginosa and M. morganii isolated from the biofilm revealed that those opportunistic pathogens are able to overcome iron restriction via the production of siderophores and high expression of corresponding receptors. Notably, a comparison of in vivo and in vitro protein profiles of P. aeruginosa and M. morganii also indicated that the bacteria employ different strategies to adapt to the urinary tract. Whilst P. aeruginosa seems to express secreted and surface-exposed proteases to escape the human innate immune system and metabolizes amino acids, M. morganii is able to take up sugars and to degrade urea. Most interestingly, a comparison of urine protein profiles of three long-term catheterized patients and three healthy control persons demonstrated the elevated level of proteins associated to neutrophils, macrophages and complement system in the patient urine, which might point to a specific activation of the innate immune system in response to biofilm-associated urinary tract infections. We thus hypothesize that the often asymptomatic nature of CAUTI´s might be based on a fine-tuned balance between the expression of bacterial virulence factors and the human immune system.

The sample was incubated on ice for 5 min, mixed intensively for 30 s and then incubated on ice for 10 min; those steps were repeated twice. Sonication was performed for 30 s and repeated five times to dissolve and lyse the cells using a Sonicator (Type UW 2070, Bandelin electronics, Berlin). Subsequently, the catheter pieces were removed and the remaining cell lysate was mixed with ice-cold acetone (1:7, v/v). After centrifugation (14,000 x g, 40 min) the resulting protein pellet was dried and solubilized in urea-containing buffer supplemented with 1% SDS. Total protein concentration was determined according to Bradford (42) employing the Coomassie PlusTM Protein Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., USA). The absorbance was measured at 595 nm. The protein concentration was calculated using a bovine serum albumin (BSA) standard (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). Metaproteomics analysis was performed in three technical replicates, i.e. the protein extract from the catheter biofilm was divided into three sub-samples.  Protein Extraction from Urine Urine samples (200 ml) from three urinary drainage bags from catheterized patients or collected from three healthy control persons were centrifuged for 20 min at 4 °C at 6000 x g and the resulting supernatants were mixed with 20% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and kept overnight at 4 °C. Subsequently, samples were centrifuged for 40 min at 14.000 x g at 4 °C, the resulting protein pellets were washed twice with 70% EtOH and thereafter solubilized in an urea-containing buffer with 1% SDS. Protein concentrations were determined as described above. Metaproteomics analyses were performed in three technical replicates, i.e. the protein extracts from urine were divided into three sub-samples.  Protein Extraction from P. aeruginosa and M. morganii Planktonic Cultures and in vitro Biofilms All in vitro proteomics analyses were performed with protein extracts of three biological replicates. Planktonic cultures of the P. aeruginosa and M. morganii isolates (see below) were grown in artificial urine medium (AUM) based on the recipe of Brooks and Keevil (43) with slight modiﬁcations (uric acid 0.333 g/l, Na2SO4 1.4 g/l). To this end, 100 ml media were inoculated to an OD600nm of 0.01 with freshly grown AUM cultures and subsequently incubated at 180 rpm at 37 °C. Cells were harvested in the early stationary growth phase by centrifugation at 6.000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C. Proteins were extracted from the resulting cell pellet as described above. The corresponding supernatants were filtered through a 0.2 µm pore filter and concentrated by a vivaspin 20 concentrator (3 kDa MWCO, GE Healthcare) followed by protein precipitation with ice-cold acetone (1:7, v/v) for the investigation of the secretome.  Biofilms were grown on silicone catheters, which were placed into planktonic AUM cultures, inoculated to an OD600nm of 0.01 and cultivated for 24 h at 50 rpm at 37 °C. Before harvesting the biofilm, the catheter was washed three times with ¼ ringer solution. Protein extraction from biofilm-grown P. aeruginosa and M. morganii was performed as described above.   1-D SDS-PAGE and Tryptic Digestion  The extracted proteins (30 - 40 µg of protein per biological or technical replicate) were separated on a 12% SDS polyacrylamide gel (44) and stained overnight with Colloidal Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 as described previously (45). Gel blocks were excised from the gel and proteins were digested with trypsin as follows: the excised gel pieces were destained using 50% (v/v) methanol in 100 mM NH4HCO3. Proteins were reduced in 50 mM NH4HCO3 by using 10 mM DTT for 30 min at 60 °C and carbamidomethylated/alkylated in 50 mM NH4HCO3 containing with 50 mM iodoacetamide for 60 min in the dark at RT. Subsequently, gel pieces were dehydrated using 100% ACN and allowed to dry. Modified trypsin (sequencing grade, Promega, Germany) was added to a final ratio of 1:10 (trypsin/ sample) in 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5 and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Peptides were iteratively extracted from the gel by a six step procedure, using ACN, 1% (v/v) formic acid in H2O, acetonitrile, 10% (v/v) formic acid and two times acetonitrile. Peptide-containing supernatants were pooled and completely dried using a Speedvac concentrator (Eppendorf AG). Samples were subsequently resolved in buffer A (5% (v/v) ACN, 0.1% (v/v) formic acid) and desalted using ZipTips (C18, Millipore). Finally, peptides were again vacuum-dried and stored at -20 °C.","dataProcessingProtocol":"Mass Spectrometric Analyses The tryptic digest was applied to a reversed phase (RP) chromatographic system (Easy-nLC II operated in “one column setup” (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA)) equipped with a self-packed RP C18 separation column (100-μm i.D. x 200 mm length) as published by Teeling et al., 2012 (46). Peptides were loaded and desalted on the column followed by elution from the column by a binary gradient of buffer A (0.1% (v/v) acetic acid) and B (99.9% (v/v) ACN, 0.1% (v/v) acetic acid) over a time of 100 min at 300 nl/min. For the analysis of peptide mixtures derived from gel blocks of one gel lane (corresponding to one sample) injection volumes were kept constant. The chromatographic system was on-line coupled to an LTQ-Orbitrap-Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) equipped with a nanoelectrospray ion source. Samples were measured in data-dependent manner with repeated cycles of overview scans in the Orbitrap (R = 30000) with the lock-mass option enabled, followed by MS/MS acquisition of the 20 most intensive precursor ions in the linear ion trap. Dynamic exclusion was enabled.  Database Assembly and Data Analysis Phylogenetic information obtained by 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used for the construction of a sample-specific virtual metagenome database designated as “catheterDB” as described by Okuda et al. (47). This database contained 342.642 non-redundant protein entries, i.e. all available proteins from Homo sapiens, P. aeruginosa, M. morganii, and Bacteroides sp. extracted from the NCBInr protein database (version 18.01.13). A second database used for protein assignments from urine samples was designated as “urineDB” and contained 46.415 entries, i.e. reference proteomes of H. sapiens, P. aeruginosa, M. morganii, E. faecalis, E. coli, P. mirabilis and B. fragilis (Uniprot, version 17.10.14 ). Since we were in particular interested in human proteins identified in the urine, the additional microbial entries (compared to “catheterDB”) were thought to minimize false positive assignments to human proteins.  Proteome discovererTM software (version 1.4, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., USA) was used to validate MS/MS based peptide and protein identifications. Sequest HT database searches were performed with raw files as MudPit experiments. The following search parameters were used: enzyme type, trypsin (KR); peptide tolerance, 10 ppm; tolerance for fragment ions, 0.6 Da; b- and y-ion series; variable modification, methionine (15.99 Da) and carbamidomethylation (57 Da); a maximum of three modifications per peptide was allowed. The percolator node was used to filter peptide identifications based on a fixed FDR of 1% depending on a target-decoy approach. Peptide identifications were accepted when they could be established on Sequest: deltaCn scores of greater than 0.05 and XCorr scores of greater 2.2, 3.3, 3.75 (XCorr filter) for doubly, triply and quadruply charged peptides. Protein identifications were based on at least two identified distinct peptides per protein. Moreover, only proteins were taken into account that were identified in two out of three technical or biological replicates (replicate filter). After application of the filters (XCorr and replicate filter) the initial FDR of 1% was reduced to 0.0001%. Proteins that contained identical peptides and could not be differentiated based on MS/MS analysis alone were grouped together.  Quantification was based on integration of the area under the curve (AUC) from MS1 spectrum peaks performed by the “Precursor Ions Area Detector” node integrated in the proteome discoverer software. Proteome discoverer identification and quantification results (*.msf) were imported into Scaffold (version 4.4, Proteome Software Inc., Portland, OR) and protein quantities were determined as the average of the three highest peptide intensity values for a protein (48). If only two peptides could be quantified, the average of the two highest peptide intensity values for a protein was calculated. Identical distinct peptides identified and quantified from different gel blocks or retention times within a sample were considered.  Normalization of these data was achieved by using the following equation: 〖 (NAUC)〗_k=〖AUC〗_k/(∑_(i=1)^N▒〖AUC〗_i ) NAUC is the normalized intensity value (AUCk) for a protein divided by the sum of all intensity values per sample (AUCi). AUCk is the average of the three highest peptide intensity values for a protein.","otherOmicsLink":null,"numProteins":46812,"numPeptides":892120,"numSpectra":636960,"numUniquePeptides":169196,"numIdentifiedSpectra":636960,"references":[{"desc":"Lassek C, Burghartz M, Chaves-Moreno D, Otto A, Hentschker C, Fuchs S, Bernhardt J, Jauregui R, Neubauer R, Becher D, Pieper DH, Jahn M, Jahn D, Riedel K.

The tryptic peptides from the secreted proteins were run on an Agilent HPLC on a C18 reverse phase column (75 µm x 150 mm, particle size 3 µm). Total run time was 90 min and flow rate 300 nl/min. Buffers used for gradient was 0.1% formic acid in water (buffer A) and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (buffer B). The buffer mixing was 5 min 5% buffer B, followed by 5%-45% buffer B in a linear gradient for 50 min, followed by 45%-80% buffer B in a linear gradient for 5 min. The 80% of buffer B was then kept for 15 min and then rapidly back to 5% buffer B for the final 15 min. The fractions from HPLC were loaded on an LCQ Deca XP Plus Ion trap mass spectrometer (ThermoScientific). Genomic DNA were prepared from all 13 LAB strains depicted earlier and sequenced at MWG Eurofins Operon (Ebensburg, Germany) using Roche GS FLX Titanium technology from Roche (Basel, Switzerland).  For each genome a shotgun library was constructed with up to 700,000 reads per segment and was generated by sequencing in 2x half segment of a full FLX+ run. Each genome had an 8 kpb long-paired end library constructed. Approximately 300,000 true paired end reads, sequence tags, and scaffolds with GS FLX+ chemistry using 2x half segment of a full run were generated. Clonal amplification was performed by emPCR in both library types. The sequencing was continued until 15-20 fold coverage was reached. The obtained reads were assembled by the software Newbler 2.6 from Roche (Basel, Switzerland). ORF prediction and automated annotation was performed at Integrated Genomics Assets Inc. (Mount Prospect, Illinois, USA).  In ORF prediction three different software were used, GLIMMER, Critica, and Prokpeg.

Comparative proteomics pointed at specific proteins recruited at the nucleoids during the recovery stage after DNA damages produced by the irradiation. Data processing and bioinformatics: Peak lists were generated with the MASCOT DAEMON software (version 2.2.2) from Matrix Science using the extract_msn.exe data import filter (ThermoFisher) from the Xcalibur FT package (version 2.0.7) from ThermoFisher.  Data import filter options were set at: 400 (minimum mass), 5000 (maximum mass), 0 (grouping tolerance), 0 (intermediate scans), and 1000 (threshold). Using the MASCOT search engine (version 2.2.04) from Matrix Science, we searched all MS/MS spectra against in-house polypeptide sequence databases. For Deinococcus radiodurans MS/MS assignments, the database contained i) the sequence of all currently annotated proteins coded by D. radiodurans BAA-816 genome (2629 proteins from chromosome 1 (NC_001263), 368 proteins from chromosome 2 (NC_001264), 130 proteins from plasmid MP1 (NC_000958), and 35 proteins from plasmid CP1 (NC_000958)), ii) 28 manual protein sequence curations from D. radiodurans R1, and iii) 121 additional ORF sequences predicted by the CONSORF consensus prediction system.This database thus comprises 3,311 polypeptide sequences, totaling 1,006,757 amino acids.

{"accession":"PXD000201","title":"Proteomic Change Associated with Flooding Injury of Soybean","projectDescription":"Flooding injury is one of the abiotic constraints on soybean growth. An experimental system established for evaluating flooding injury in soybean seedlings indicated that the degree of injury is dependent on seedling density in floodwater. To understand the molecular mechanism responsible for the injury, proteomic alterations in soybean seedlings that correlated with severity of stress were analyzed using label-free quantitative proteomics. Two-day-old soybeans, seedlings flooded for 2 days and hypocotyls of seedlings grown for 3 days after flooding were analyzed. The radicles of soybean seedlings were separated to root tips (RT), roots without tip (RwoT) and hypocotyls (Hypo). Protein was extracted from these organs by TCA/Acetone method. Protein samples were cleaned up with chloroform/methanol method and then subjected to in-solution digestion with trypsin. Resulting peptides were analyzed on a nanospray LTQ XL Orbitrap MS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) operated in data-dependent acquisition mode with the installed Xcalibur software (version 2.0.7, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Using an Ultimate 3,000 nanoLC system (Dionex), peptides in 0.1% formic acid were loaded onto a C18 PepMap trap column (300 µm ID × 5 mm, Dionex). The peptides were eluted from the trap column and their separation and spraying were done using 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile at a flow rate of 200 nL/min on a C18 Tip column (75 µm 1D × 120 mm, nano HPLC capillary column, NTTC-360/75-3, Nikkyo Technos) with a spray voltage of 1.5 kV. The elution was done with a linear acetonitrile gradient 8-30% in 120 min for gel free proteomics in 0.1% formic acid. Full-scan mass spectra were acquired in the Orbitrap over a mass range of 400-1,500 m/z with a resolution of 30,000. A lock mass function was used to obtain high mass accuracy. The top 6 most intense precursor ions were selected for collision-induced fragmentation in the linear ion trap at normalized collision energy of 35%. Dynamic exclusion was employed within 90 sec to prevent repetitive selection of peptides.Identification of proteins were performed by Mascot search engine (version 2.3.0.2, Matrix Science) using soybean peptide database (55,787 sequences) obtained from the soybean genome database (Phytozome version 8.0)and a common contaminants database (262 sequences). Parameters used in Mascot searches were follows: Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was set as a fixed modification, and oxidation of methionine was set as a variable modification. Trypsin was specified as the proteolytic enzyme and one missed cleavage was allowed. Peptide mass tolerance was set at 5 ppm, fragment mass tolerance was set at 0.5 Da, and peptide charge was set at +2, +3, and +4. Automatic decoy database search was performed in the search. Mascot results were filtered with Mascot percolator to improve accuracy and sensitivity in the peptide identification.

{"accession":"PXD000210","title":"Proteome analysis by charge state-selective separation of peptides: a multidimensional approach","projectDescription":"Multidimensional peptide fractionation is widely used in proteomics to reduce the complexity of peptide mixtures prior to mass spectrometric analysis. Here, we describe the sequential use of strong cation exchange and reversed phase liquid chromatography in both basic and acidic pH buffers for separating tryptic peptides from complex mixtures of proteins. Strong cation exchange exclusively separates peptide by their charge state into neutral, singly and multi-charged species. To further reduce complexity, each peptide group was separated by reversed phase liquid chromatography at basic pH and the resultant fractions were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. This workflow was applied to a soluble protein lysate from mouse embryonic fibroblast cells were more than 5000 proteins from 30470 peptides were identified. The high selectivity displayed during the SCX step (95% to 100%) and the overlaps between proteins identified from the SCX-separated peptide groups, result in additional assets of the procedure that significantly increase the confidence of protein identifications.   Raw data files were processed with Mascot Distiller (2.2), the mgf files were searched with Mascot Daemon (2.4), all data was stored in ms_lims  Fixed modifications: cysteine alkylation Variable modifications: methionine oxidation, protein N-terminus acetylation, pyroglutamate formation of N-terminal glutamine, cyclic carbamate formation of N-terminal threonine or serine Enzyme: trypsin/P with 2 missed cleavages allowed Precursor mass tolerance: 10 ppm Peptide fragment mass tolerance: 0.5 Da Database: Swiss Prot mouse (version 56.4)   The xml files of RH0 - RH1 - RH2 CID were created with pride converter 2.5.5 because this is still able to link to ms_lims.

{"accession":"PXD000211","title":"Arabidopsis nanodomain-delimited ABA signaling pathway regulates the anion channnel SLAH3","projectDescription":"Analysis of Arabidopsis nanodomains shows that Arabidopsis nanodomain-delimited ABA signaling pathway regulates the anion channnel SLAH3. The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) plays a key role in the plant response to drought stress. Hence, ABA-dependent gene transcription and ion transport is regulated by a variety of protein kinases and phosphatases. However, the nature of the membrane delimited ABA signal transduction steps remains largely unknown. To gain insight into plasma membrane-bound ABA signaling, we identified sterol-dependent proteins associated with detergent resistant membranes from Arabidopsis thaliana mesophyll cells. Among those, we detected the central ABA signaling phosphatase ABI1 (abscisic-acid insensitive 1) and the calcium-dependent protein kinase 21 (CPK21). Using fluorescence microscopy, we found these proteins to localize in membrane nanodomains, as observed by colocalization with the nanodomain marker remorin AtRem 1.3. After transient coexpression, CPK21 interacted with SLAH3 (SLAC1 homolog 3) and activated this anion channel. Upon CPK21 stimulation, SLAH3 exhibited the hallmark properties of S-type anion channels. Coexpression of SLAH3/CPK21 with ABI1, however, prevented proper nanodomain localization of the SLAH3/CPK21 protein complex, and as a result anion channel activation failed. FRET studies revealed enhanced interaction of SLAH3 and CPK21 within the plasma membrane in response to ABA and thus confirmed our initial observations. Interestingly, the ABA-induced SLAH3/CPK21 interaction was modulated by ABI1 and the ABA receptor RCAR1/PYL9. We therefore propose that ABA signaling via inhibition of ABI1 modulates the apparent association of a signaling and transport complex within membrane domains that is necessary for phosphorylation and activation of the S-type anion channel SLAH3 by CPK21. Data processing and bioinformatics: MS result peak files were run on a Mascot daemon using the Mascot algorithm (version 2.2; Matrix Science) with TAIR v9 protein database, trypsin/P as protease. Allowed fixed modification was carbamidomethylation (C), and variable modifications were oxidized methionines (N) and pyroglutamic acid (pyro-Glu at N-terminal Q). Peptide and fragment mass tolerance were set to +-1.5 Da for the ion trap and +-0.2 Da for the Quad-TOF, maximum missed cleavages to two, and only singly, doubly, and triply charged ions were analyzed. After manual inspection, protein identifications with at least three unique identified peptides were automatically approved. Protein identifications based on two unique identified were only regarded if the two unique identified peptides displayed an ions score above the Mascot significance threshold for P < 0.05 (Mascot score >40 for the ion trap and >32 for the QUAD-TOF). Detailed information for the identified proteins was queried from the Uniprot consortium database (www.uniprot.org) and The Arabidopsis Information Center (TAIR: www.arabidopsis.org). The functional classification was assigned manually according to the annotations found in these two databases. Two independent biological replicates were analyzed: first setup of DRM isolation was performed with the detergents TritonX-100 and Brij-98 in-solution and in-gel digested. The second setup for DRM isolation was only performed with the detergent Triton X-100 and in-gel digested but subjected to methylcyclodextrin treatment to identify sterol-dependent lipid nanodomain proteins. For the proteomic analysis of DRMs data sets from both experimental setups were analyzed; the MCD treatment was only analyzed for the second setup. Protein amounts were estimated only for the MCD treatment using the Exponentially Modified Protein Abundance Index, which correlates with the number of observed and observable peptides per protein.","publicationDate":"2013-05-01","submissionType":"COMPLETE","numAssays":9,"species":["Arabidopsis thaliana (Mouse-ear cress)"],"tissues":[],"ptmNames":["iodoacetamide derivatized residue","deaminated residue","iodoacetamide - site C","monohydroxylated residue","2-pyrrolidone-5-carboxylic acid (Gln)"],"instrumentNames":["instrument model"],"projectTags":[],"doi":"10.6019/PXD000211","submitter":{"title":"Dr","firstName":"Yvonne","lastName":"Reinders","email":"yr@proteomics-online.de","affiliation":"Department of Biochemistry"},"labHeads":[],"submissionDate":"2013-04-10","reanalysis":null,"experimentTypes":["Bottom-up proteomics"],"quantificationMethods":[],"keywords":"plant, arabidopsis, lipid rafts","sampleProcessingProtocol":"Not available","dataProcessingProtocol":"Not available","otherOmicsLink":null,"numProteins":7565,"numPeptides":35610,"numSpectra":34187,"numUniquePeptides":10596,"numIdentifiedSpectra":34187,"references":[{"desc":"Demir F, Horntrich C, Blachutzik JO, Scherzer S, Reinders Y, Kierszniowska S, Schulze WX, Harms GS, Hedrich R, Geiger D, Kreuzer I; Arabidopsis nanodomain-delimited ABA signaling pathway regulates the anion channel SLAH3., Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 2013 May 14, 110, 20, 8296-301, ","ids":["DOI:10.1073/pnas.1211667110","PMID:23630285"]}]}

Imatinib mesylate has emerged as the leading compound to treat chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), through its inhibition of Bcr- Abl tyrosine kinases, and other cancers. However, resistance to imatinib develops frequently, particularly in late-stage disease and has necessitated the development of new BCR-ABL inhibitors. The synthesis of a new series of phenylaminopyrimidines, structurally related to imatinib showed large interest since the introduction of the nilotibin. To identify the cellular pathways affected by new synthesized compounds, we applied mass spectrometry together with stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) for the comparative study of protein expression in K562 cells that were untreated or treated with imatinib and imatinib derivates. Further, the global proteome of the K562 cells treated with imatinib were quantitatively compared with the cells treated with the new compounds. This study enriched our knowledge about direct cellular targets of kinase selective drugs. Further the results offered important new knowledge for gaining insights into the structural effects of action of the new compounds.  Samples were analyzed on a longer column (30cm) and a longer gradient (180min). Raw data files were processed with Mascot distiller 2.3. The mgf files were searched with Mascot daemon 2.3. The quantification was also done by Mascot Distiller.  All data was stored in ms_lims. The manual validation of false peptide ratios was done with Rover (part of ms_lims).  Fixed modifications: none.

How cells recover from a DNA damage-induced arrest is currently poorly understood. We have performed large-scale quantitative phosphoproteomics to identify changes in protein phosphorylation that occur during recovery from a G2 arrest. We identified 154 proteins that were differentially phosphorylated in multiple experiments. Systematic depletion of each of these differentially phosphorylated proteins by siRNA identified at least 10 potential regulators of recovery. Data processing and bioinformatics: Raw data were converted to single DTA files using DTA SuperCharge and merged into Mascot Generic Format (MGF) files, which were searched using an in-house licensed Mascot v2.2 search engine against Human Swissprot 56.2 database concatenated with reversed sequences as decoy (containing 40656 sequences, 20328 forward sequences).  Carbamidomethyl cysteine and oxidized methionines were set as fixed modifications; serine, threonine, and tyrosine phosphorylations were set as variable modifications; quantification was set with dimethyl double mode. The mass tolerance of the precursor ion was 10 ppm and 0.9 Da for fragment ions. The false discovery rate (FDR) was determined as < 1% (Mascot score threshold of 31) using the decoy database approach and the MGF files were trimmed at Mascot score threshold of 31 (1% FDR) by RockerBox. MSQuant v1.5 was used to quantitate the amounts of the identified phosphopeptides and determine the exact phosphorylation site within the peptide. Every phosphopeptide quantitation was manually validated; peptides with low signal:noise ratios, low number of MS scans, or overlapping peaks were not included for quantitative purposes. Histogram plots of the ratio of whole quantified peptides in each experiment were used to normalize the ratios. A program to extract information from MSQuant output was developed in-house to identify the position of each phosphorylation site and its status in current available databases (Phospho ELM and SwissProt). Panther Classification System was used to classify proteins with regulated phosphopeptides.

They regulate gas exchange between plants and atmosphere, allowing plants to adapt to changing environmental conditions. ABA binding to receptors initiates a signaling cascade that involves protein phosphorylation. Here we show that ABA induced phosphorylation of three basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors, called AKSs (ABA-RESPONSIVE KINASE SUBSTRATES; AKS1, AKS2, AKS3), in Arabidopsis guard cells, and that they facilitated stomatal opening through the transcription of genes encoding inwardly-rectifying K+ channels. aks1aks2-1 double mutant plants showed decreases in light-induced stomatal opening, K+ accumulation in response to light, activity of inwardly-rectifying K+ channels, and transcription of genes encoding major inwardly-rectifying K+ channels without affecting ABA-mediated stomatal closure. Overexpression of POTASSIUM CHANNEL IN ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA 1 (KAT1), which encodes a major inwardly-rectifying K+ channel in guard cells, rescued the phenotype of aks1aks2-1 plants. AKS1 bound directly to the promoter of KAT1, an interaction that was attenuated after ABA-induced phosphorylation. The ABA agonist pyrabactin induced phosphorylation of AKSs. Our results demonstrate that the AKS family of bHLH transcription factors facilitates stomatal opening through transcription of genes encoding inwardly-rectifying K+ channels, and that ABA suppresses the activity of inwardly-rectifying K+ channel activity by triggering the phosphorylation of these transcription factors.

The apoptotic phenotype and mechanism by which it induces cell death however, remain poorly understood and controversial. Here, we show that GrM-induced cell death was largely caspase-dependent with various hallmarks of classical apoptosis, coinciding with caspase-independent G2/M cell cycle arrest. Using positional proteomics in HeLa cells, we identified the nuclear enzyme topoisomerase II alpha (topoII alpha) as a physiological substrate of GrM. Cleavage of topoII alpha by GrM at Leu1280 dissected topoII aplha functional domains from the nuclear localization signals, leading to nuclear exit of topoII alpha catalytic activity into the cytoplasm, and rendering it nonfunctional. Similar to the apoptotic phenotype of GrM, topoII aplha depletion in tumor cells led to cell cycle arrest in G2/M, mitochondrial perturbations, caspase activation, and apoptosis. We conclude that cytotoxic lymphocyte GrM targets topoII aplha to trigger cell cycle arrest and caspase-dependent apoptosis.  Raw data files were processed with Mascot distiller 2.3.

MO3.13 also exhibit the markers of immature oligodendrocytes GalC (galactosylceramidase) and CNPase. Upon differentiation, the MO3.13 cells have been also shown to express the MBP and MOG markers. Data analysis: Each MS raw file was processed using ProteoWizard for the generation of a MGF file. These were processed in SearchGUI, which runs the search engines Open Mass Spectrometry Search Algorithm (OMSSA) and X!Tandem against the UniProt human protein database (release 2013_08, 20,266 sequences).  Search parameters were: peptide and fragment ion mass accuracy 10 ppm and 0.5 Da, respectively; protein and peptide FDRs 1%; two miss cleavages; trypsin as enzyme; fixed modifications: cysteine carbamidomethylation; variable modifications: methionine oxidation. In order to generate one single proteome dataset of MO3.13, resulting data was processed in PeptideShaker.","publicationDate":"2013-10-08","submissionType":"COMPLETE","numAssays":1,"species":["Homo sapiens (Human)"],"tissues":["brain"],"ptmNames":["iodoacetamide derivatized amino-terminal residue","monohydroxylated residue"],"instrumentNames":["LTQ Orbitrap","instrument model"],"projectTags":["Biomedical"],"doi":"10.6019/PXD000263","submitter":{"title":"Dr","firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Martins-de-Souza","email":"danms90@gmail.com","affiliation":"Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology"},"labHeads":[],"submissionDate":"2013-08-27","reanalysis":null,"experimentTypes":["Bottom-up proteomics"],"quantificationMethods":[],"keywords":"Human; oligodendrocytes; proteome; C-HPP","sampleProcessingProtocol":"Not available","dataProcessingProtocol":"Not available","otherOmicsLink":null,"numProteins":18505,"numPeptides":75124,"numSpectra":165697,"numUniquePeptides":34456,"numIdentifiedSpectra":57839,"references":[{"desc":"Iwata K, Café-Mendes CC, Schmitt A, Steiner J, Manabe T, Matsuzaki H, Falkai P, Turck CW, Martins-de-Souza D; The human oligodendrocyte proteome., Proteomics, 2013 Dec, 13, 23-24, 3548-53, ","ids":["PMID:24167090","DOI:10.1002/pmic.201300201"]}]}

{"accession":"PXD000276","title":"Quantitative analysis of fission yeast transcriptomes and proteomes in proliferating and quiescent cells","projectDescription":"Data on absolute molecule numbers will empower the modeling, understanding, and comparison of cellular functions and biological systems. We quantified transcriptomes and proteomes in fission yeast during cellular proliferation and quiescence. This rich resource provides the first comprehensive reference for all RNA and most protein concentrations in a eukaryote under two key physiological conditions. The integrated data set supports quantitative biology and affords unique insights into cell regulation. Although mRNAs are typically expressed in a narrow range above 1 copy/cell, most long, noncoding RNAs, except for a distinct subset, are tightly repressed below 1 copy/cell. Cell-cycle-regulated transcription tunes mRNA numbers to phase-specific requirements but can also bring about more switch-like expression. Proteins greatly exceed mRNAs in abundance and dynamic range, and concentrations are regulated to functional demands. Upon transition to quiescence, the proteome changes substantially, but, in stark contrast to mRNAs, proteins do not uniformly decrease but scale with cell volume. Proteomics data generation and processing: Extracted proteins were enzymatically digested using trypsin, the peptides were separated into 12 fractions using an OFF-GEL Fractionator (Agilent), and analyzed on an Orbitrap Velos LC-MS platform (Thermo Scientific). Peptides were quantified and identified using the Progenesis LC-MS (Nonlinear Dynamics) and Mascot software, respectively. Absolute abundance for 39 proteins was determined using spiked-in heavy reference peptides to translate the summed MS-intensities of all peptides to copies/cell for all identified proteins.

{"accession":"PXD000280","title":"Arabidopsis thaliana Cytochrome c Novel Partners Identification by LTQ","projectDescription":"Programmed cell death is an event displayed by many different organisms along the evolutionary scale. In plants, it is necessary for development and for the hypersensitive response to stress or pathogenic infection. A common feature to programmed cell death among organisms is the mitochondria-to-cytosol translocation of cytochrome c. To understand the role of cytochrome c in the onset of plant programmed cell death, a proteomic approach based on affinity chromatography has been developed, using Arabidopsis cytochrome c as bait. Eleven putative, new cytochrome c partners have been identified. Nine of them bind the heme protein in plant protoplasts and in human cells, as a heterologous system, according to Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation. The binding affinities and the kinetic rate constants of three cytochrome c - target complexes have been estimated by Surface Plasmon Resonance. Our data suggest that the role of cytochrome c as a programmed cell death-signaling messenger could be evolutionarily well-conserved. Data Processing & data analysis: Peptides were analyzed using a nanoliquid chromatography-MS/MS on an LTQ linear ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron San Jose, CA, USA).  The mass spectrometer was operated in the data-dependent mode to automatically switch between full MS and MS/MS acquisition. The parameters for ion scanning were the following: Full-scan MS(400-1800 m/z) plus top seven peaks Zoom/MS/MS (isolation width 2 m/z), normalized collision energy 35%. The scanning was performed using a dynamic exclusion list (120s exclusion list size of 50). Peak lists from all MS/MS spectra were extracted from the  Xcalibur  RAW  files  using  a  freely  available  program  DTAsupercharge  v.1.19 (http://msquant.sourceforge.net/).

{"accession":"PXD000283","title":"Comparison and applications of label-free absolute proteome quantification methods on Escherichia coli","projectDescription":"Three different label-free proteome quantification methods - APEX, emPAI and iBAQ - were evaluated to measure proteome-wide protein concentrations in the cell. All the methods were applied to a sample from Escherichia coli chemostat culture. A Pearson squared correlation of approximately 0.6 among the three quantification methods was demonstrated. Importantly, the sum of quantified proteins by iBAQ and emPAI corresponded with the Lowry total protein quantification, demonstrating applicability of label-free methods for an accurate calculation of protein concentrations at the proteome level. The iBAQ method showed the best correlation between biological replicates, a normal distribution among all protein abundances, and the lowest variation among ribosomal protein abundances, which are expected to have equal amounts. Absolute quantitative proteome data enabled us to evaluate metabolic cost for protein synthesis and apparent catalytic activities of enzymes by integration with flux analysis. All the methods demonstrated similar ATP costs for protein synthesis for different cellular processes and that costs for expressing biomass synthesis related proteins were higher than those for energy generation. Importantly, catalytic activities of energy metabolism enzymes were an order or two higher than those of monomer synthesis. Interestingly, a staircase-like protein expression was demonstrated for most of the transcription units.        Fragment MS/MS spectra from raw files were extracted as MSM files and then merged to peak lists using the Raw2MSM version 1.7 [29], selecting top six peaks for 100 Da. MSM files for the three technical replicates of the same sample were concatenated to generate a single large peak list file with a MultiRawPrepare.pl script (http://msquant.alwaysdata.net) and subsequently searched with the Mascot 2.2 search engine (Matrix Science, London, UK) against the E. coli K-12 MG1655 protein sequence database downloaded 22.09.2009 from EcoGene 2.0 (http://ecogene.org), supplemented with common contaminants. Search parameters were as follows: two missed trypsin cleavage, fixed modification was set as carbamidomethyl (C), variable modifications were set as oxidation (M) and acetyl (protein N-term), 5 ppm precursor mass tolerance and 0.6 Da MS/MS mass tolerance. In order to estimate the false discovery rate (FDR) decoy search option was allowed.        The Mascot search results were validated by the PeptideProphet and ProteinProphet algorithms [30] before the absolute protein expression indexes (APEX) [19] were calculated by the APEX Quantitative Proteomics Tool [25]. An estimated false positive rate (FPR) cut-off of less than 5% was used, which corresponded to the ProteinProphet probability p greater than 0.5. FPR less than 5% was chosen, as this resulted in a reasonable number of quantified proteins (1220), comparable with the iBAQ dataset (1334 proteins). Limiting the FPR to less than 1% would result in the loss of more than 200 proteins.","publicationDate":"2013-07-23","submissionType":"COMPLETE","numAssays":2,"species":["Escherichia coli"],"tissues":["cell culture"],"ptmNames":["iodoacetamide derivatized residue","monohydroxylated residue","acetylated residue"],"instrumentNames":["LTQ Orbitrap","instrument model"],"projectTags":[],"doi":"10.6019/PXD000283","submitter":{"title":"Miss","firstName":"Liisa","lastName":"Arike","email":"liisa@tftak.eu","affiliation":"Competence Center for Food and Fermentation Technologies"},"labHeads":[],"submissionDate":"2013-06-25","reanalysis":null,"experimentTypes":["Bottom-up proteomics"],"quantificationMethods":[],"keywords":"E. coli, shotgun proteomics, UPS2, iBAQ","sampleProcessingProtocol":"Not available","dataProcessingProtocol":"Not available","otherOmicsLink":null,"numProteins":5329,"numPeptides":130763,"numSpectra":308602,"numUniquePeptides":20250,"numIdentifiedSpectra":100810,"references":[{"desc":"Arike L, Valgepea K, Peil L, Nahku R, Adamberg K, Vilu R; Comparison and applications of label-free absolute proteome quantification methods on Escherichia coli., J Proteomics, 2012 Sep 18, 75, 17, 5437-48, ","ids":["DOI:10.1016/j.jprot.2012.06.020","PMID:22771841"]}]}

Amyloid deposits were isolated from two corneal specimens with atypical LCD type 1 due to a A546D/P551Q mutation in TGFBI using laser capture microdissection and a subsequent analysis by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The findings were compared to the previous findings of a A546D LCD type 1 plaque proteome. Proteolytic processing of TGFBIp was addressed by counting peptide spectra obtained during the mass spectrometry (MS) analyses. Lastly, to study the effect of the P551Q substitution, recombinant FAS1-4 variants (wild type, A546D, A546D/P551Q, and P551Q) were expressed, purified and subjected to in vitro stability assays including circular dichroism, transverse urea gradient gel electrophoresis, and limited proteolysis. Plaque proteomes of the two A546D/P551Q LCD type 1 cases were similar to each other as well as to A564D plaque proteome previously reported. Major proteins associated with the deposits were TGFBIp, serum amyloid P, clusterin, HtrA1, Apolipoproteins A-1, A-IV, D, and E. Proteolytic processing of TGFBIp were also similar in all LCD type 1 cases regardless of the mutation indicating that a C-terminal TGFBIp polypeptide had accumulated in the deposits. The stability assays revealed a minor destabilization of FAS1-4 upon the addition of the P551Q mutation, however, enough to result in different accessibility to proteolytic processing by trypsin for the A546D and A546D/P551Q FAS1-4 variants. Difference in A546D and A546D/P551Q LCD type 1 phenotypes is not ascribed to altered plaque formation or altered proteolytic processing of TGFBIp. Instead, a small decrease in thermodynamic stability introduced by the P551Q mutation is believed to affect TGFBIp fibrillation and proteolytic accessibility of TGFBIp, thereby resulting in the different phenotypes observed in vivo. *Data handling:* Raw data were converted to mgf format using Protein Pilot software (AB Sciex) and searched using an in-house Mascot search engine (Matrix Science, London, UK; version: 2.3.02) against the Swiss-Prot database (version: 2012_05). Enzyme was set to semi-trypsin, and missed cleavage was 1. No fixed modifications were added. Instead oxidation of methionine and proline were included as variable modifications. The MS tolerance and MS/MS tolerance were 10 ppm and 0.4 Da, respectively. Duo, triple, and quadric charges of precursor ions were selected and an ESI-QUAD-TOF system was set as the instrument used. All data sets were simultaneously searched against the decoy database to apply a false discovery rate (FDR) between 1.5 to 7% and a p-value < 0.01. Peptides with an ion score lower than 30 were rejected. Peptide spectra for protein hits identified by only one peptide were manually inspected, thereby reducing the FDR value.

{"accession":"PXD000314","title":"Sequential Phosphoproteomic Enrichment by Complementary Metal-directed Immobilized Metal Ion Affinity Chromatography: Case Study on Kinase Substrate Mapping in Human Lung Cancer Tissue","projectDescription":"Abstract: Despite recent advances in instrumentation and analytical strategies for identification and quantitation of protein phosphorylation, methodologies to enrich the heterogeneous types of phosphopeptides are critical towards comprehensive mapping of the under-explored phosphoproteome. Taking advantage of the distinctive binding affinity of Ga3+ and Fe3+ towards phosphopeptides, we designed a tip-based metal-directed immobilized metal ion affinity (MD-IMAC) chromatography for sequential enrichment of phosphopeptides. On the analysis of Raji B cell, this sequential Ga3+-Fe3+-IMAC strategy demonstrated 1.5-3.5 fold superior phosphoproteomic coverage compared to the single IMAC (Fe3+, Ti4+, Ga3+ and Al3+). In addition, as high as 92% among the 6283 phosphopeptides was uniquely enriched by either 1st Ga3+-IMAC fraction (41%) or 2nd Fe3+-IMAC fraction (51%).  The complementary property of Ga3+ and Fe3+ was further shown on the exclusively superior efficiency to enriched almost all the 1214 multiply phosphorylated peptides (99.4%) by 1st Ga3+-IMAC, while as low as 10% of 5069 monophosphorylated phosphopeptides was commonly enriched by both fractions. Application of our sequential Ga3+-Fe3+-IMAC approach to a human lung cancer tissue allowed the identification of 2560 unique phosphopeptides with only 8% overlapping. The fractionation ability was shown not only on the mono phosphopeptides and multiply phosphopeptides but also on the basic and acidic phosphopeptides; acidiphilic phosphorylation sites were predominately present in 1st Ga3+-IMAC (72%) and 85% Pro-directed and 79% basophilic phosphorylation sites were enriched by 2nd Fe3+-IMAC. Most interestingly, this strategy complementarily mapped different kinase substrate on the protein as well as site levels in multiple cellular pathways related to cancer invasion and metastasis of lung cancer ., Given the demonstrated fractionation ability, reproducibility, sensitivity and ease of tip preparation, we hope that this Ga3+-Fe3+-IMAC allow more comprehensive characterization of phosphoproteome in vitro and in vivo.  Database search: The raw MS/MS data obtained by TripleTOF 5600 were processed using AB_SCIEX MS Data Converter with default parameters. All MS/MS files were analyzed using Mascot (Matrix Science, London, UK; version 2.3) against the SwissPort database (version 57.8) with the following constraints: an allowance for tryptic peptides of up to two missed cleavage sites, a fragment ion mass tolerance of 0.05 Da, and a parent ion tolerance of 10 ppm. Phosphorylation (S, T, Y) and oxidation (M) were selected as variable modifications. Searching on a randomized decoy database created by Mascot was required to evaluate the false discovery rate associated with protein identification. The false discovery rates with a Mascot score (p< 0.05) ranged between 0% and 1% in this study.","publicationDate":"2014-01-29","submissionType":"COMPLETE","numAssays":29,"species":["Homo sapiens (Human)"],"tissues":["lung","cell culture"],"ptmNames":["phosphorylated residue","monohydroxylated residue"],"instrumentNames":["instrument model"],"projectTags":[],"doi":"10.6019/PXD000314","submitter":{"title":"Mr","firstName":"Chia-Feng","lastName":"Tsai","email":"grazzilybear@gmail.com","affiliation":"Institute of Chemistry"},"labHeads":[],"submissionDate":"2013-07-01","reanalysis":null,"experimentTypes":["Bottom-up proteomics"],"quantificationMethods":[],"keywords":"Sequential IMAC, human lung cancer tissue, phosphoproteomics","sampleProcessingProtocol":"Not available","dataProcessingProtocol":"Not available","otherOmicsLink":null,"numProteins":24901,"numPeptides":80471,"numSpectra":506896,"numUniquePeptides":39028,"numIdentifiedSpectra":74368,"references":[{"desc":"Tsai CF, Hsu CC, Hung JN, Wang YT, Choong WK, Zeng MY, Lin PY, Hong RW, Sung TY, Chen YJ.

{"accession":"PXD000316","title":"A Saccharomyces Cerevisiae model reveals in vivo functional impairment of the ogden syndrome n-terminal acetyltransferase Naa10-S37p mutant","projectDescription":"Abstract: N-terminal acetylation (Nt-acetylation) occurs on the majority of eukaryotic proteins and is catalysed by N-terminal acetyltransferases (NATs). Nt- acetylation is increasingly recognized as a vital modification with functional implications ranging from protein degradation to protein localization.  Very recently, the first human X-linked genetic disorder caused by a mutation in a NAT gene was reported; Ogden syndrome boys harbour a p.Ser37Pro  variant in the gene encoding Naa10, the catalytic subunit of the NatA complex, and suffer from global developmental delays and lethality during infancy.  Here, we developed a Saccharomyces cerevisiae model by introducing the human wildtype or mutant NatA complex into yeast lacking NatA (NatA-∆). The human  NatA complex phenotypically complemented the NatA-∆ strain, while only a partial rescue was observed for the Ogden mutant NatA complex suggesting that  hNaa10-S37P is only partially functional in vivo. Furthermore, we performed quantitative Nt-acetylome analyses on a control yeast strain (yNatA), a yeast  NatA deletion strain (yNatA-∆), a yeast NatA deletion strain expressing human NatA (hNatA), and a yeast NatA deletion strain expressing mutant human NatA  (hNatA-hNaa10-S37P). Interestingly, a reduced degree of Nt-acetylation was specifically observed among a large group of NatA substrates in the yeast  expressing mutant hNatA as compared to yeast expressing wildtype hNatA. Furthermore, immunoprecipitated mutant NatA complex displayed a reduced catalytic  activity in vitro as compared to the wildtype NatA complex. Combined, these data provide strong support for the functional impairment of hNaa10-S37P in  vivo and suggest that reduced Nt-acetylation of one or more target substrates contributes to the pathogenesis of Ogden syndrome. Comparative analysis  between human and yeast NatA also provided novel insights into the co-evolution of the NatA complexes and their substrates. For instance, (Met-)Ala- N- termini are more prevalent in the human proteome as compared to the yeast proteome, and hNatA displays a relative preference towards these N-termini as  compared to yNatA.    Methods: The obtained peptide mixtures were introduced into an LC-MS/MS system, the Ultimate 3000 (Dionex, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) in-line connected to an LTQ  Orbitrap XL (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany). Samples were first loaded on a trapping column (made in-house, 100 µm internal diameter (I.D.) x  20 mm, 5 µm beads C18 Reprosil-HD, Dr. Maisch). After back-flushing from the trapping column, the sample was loaded on a reverse-phase column (made in- house, 75 µm I.D. x 150 mm , 5 µm beads C18 Reprosil-HD, Dr. Maisch). Peptides were loaded with solvent A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 2% acetonitrile),  and were separated with a linear gradient from 2% solvent A’ (0.05% formic acid) to 55% solvent B’ (0.05% formic acid and 80% acetonitrile) at a flow  rate of 300 nl/min followed by a wash reaching 100% solvent B’. The mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent mode, automatically switching  between MS and MS/MS acquisition for the six most abundant peaks in a given MS spectrum. Full scan MS spectra were acquired in the Orbitrap at a target  value of 1E6 with a resolution of 60,000. The six most intense ions were then isolated for fragmentation in the linear ion trap, with a dynamic exclusion  of 60 s. Peptides were fragmented after filling the ion trap at a target value of 1E4 ion counts. From the MS/MS data in each LC run, Mascot Generic  Files were created using the Mascot Distiller software (version 2.3.01, Matrix Science). While generating these peak lists, grouping of spectra was  allowed with a maximum intermediate retention time of 30 s and a maximum intermediate scan count of 5 was used where possible. Grouping was done with  0.005 Da precursor tolerance. A peak list was only generated when the MS/MS spectrum contained more than 10 peaks. There was no de-isotoping and the  relative signal to noise limit was set at 2. These peak lists were then searched with the Mascot search engine (Matrix Science) using the Mascot Daemon  interface (version 2.3, Matrix Science).  Spectra were searched against the yeast (S. cerevisiae) Swiss-Prot database (version 2011_03  of the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot protein database containing  7,320 yeast sequence entries (525997 sequences in total)). )). 13C2D3- [(13C2)-trideutero-acetylation] at lysines, carbamidomethylation of cysteine and  methionine oxidation to methionine-sulfoxide were set as fixed modifications for the N-terminal COFRADIC analyses. Variable modifications were 13C2D3-  acetylation and acetylation of protein N-termini. Pyroglutamate formation of N-terminal glutamine was additionally set as a variable modification. Mass  tolerance on precursor ions was set to 10 ppm (with Mascot’s C13 option set to 1) and on fragment ions to 0.5 Da. Endoproteinase semi-Arg-C/P (Arg-C  specificity with arginine-proline cleavage allowed) was set as enzyme allowing no missed cleavages. The peptide charge was set to 1+, 2+, 3+ and  instrument setting was put on ESI-TRAP. Only peptides that were ranked one and scored above the threshold score, set at 99% confidence, were withheld.  The estimated false discovery rate by searching decoy databases was typically found to lie between 2 and 4% on the spectrum level [33]. Quantification of  the degree of Nt-Ac was performed as described previously (5). All data management was done in ms_lims ([49]).    Please note!! the pride result files will show a lot of delta m/z deviations. The modification for the heavy acetylation (+47 Da) used in this experiment is not in Pride. So another heavy acetylation (+45 Da) modification was annotated when creating the xml files.","publicationDate":"2014-01-29","submissionType":"COMPLETE","numAssays":4,"species":["Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker's yeast)"],"tissues":[],"ptmNames":["L-methionine sulfoxide","iodoacetamide derivatized residue","2-pyrrolidone-5-carboxylic acid (Gln)","N-acetylated residue","acetate labeling reagent (N-term) (heavy form, +3amu)"],"instrumentNames":["LTQ Orbitrap","instrument model"],"projectTags":[],"doi":"10.6019/PXD000316","submitter":{"title":"Dr","firstName":"Pieter-Jan","lastName":"De Bock","email":"pieter-jan.debock@cea.fr","affiliation":"Biochemistry"},"labHeads":[],"submissionDate":"2013-07-01","reanalysis":null,"experimentTypes":["Bottom-up proteomics"],"quantificationMethods":[],"keywords":"Yeast, LC-MSMS, N-terminal COFRADIC","sampleProcessingProtocol":"Not available","dataProcessingProtocol":"Not available","otherOmicsLink":null,"numProteins":8712,"numPeptides":49249,"numSpectra":391269,"numUniquePeptides":28196,"numIdentifiedSpectra":49249,"references":[{"desc":"Van Damme P, Støve SI, Glomnes N, Gevaert K, Arnesen T.

{"accession":"PXD000318","title":"Spider genomes provide insight into composition, function and evolution of venom and silk","projectDescription":"Spiders are a highly diverse group of arthropods that occur in most habitats on land. Notably, spiders have significant ecological impact as predators because of their extraordinary prey capture adaptations, venom and silk. Spider venom is among the most heterogeneous animal venoms and has pharmacological applications, while spider silk is characterized by great toughness with potential for biomaterial application. We describe the genome sequences of two spiders representing two major taxonomic groups, the social velvet spider Stegodyphus mimosarum (Araneomorphae), and the Brazilian white-knee tarantula Acanthoscurria geniculata (Mygalomorphae). We annotate genes using a combination of transcriptomic and in-depth proteomic analyses. The genomes are large (2.6 Gb and 6 Gb, respectively) with short exons and long introns and approximately 50% repeats, reminiscent of typical mammalian genomes. Phylogenetic analyses show that spiders and ticks are sister groups outgrouped by mites, and phylogenetic dating using a molecular clock dates separation of velvet spider and tarantula at 270 my. Based on the genomes and proteomes, we characterize the genetic basis of venom and silk production of both species in detail. Venom protein composition differs markedly between the two spiders, with lipases as the most abundant protein in the velvet spider and present only at low concentration in tarantula. Venom in both spiders contains proteolytic enzymes, and our analyses suggest that these enzymes target and process precursor peptides that subsequently mediate the toxic effects of venom. Complete analysis of silk genes reveal a diverse suite of silk proteins in the velvet spider including novel types of spidroins, and dynamic evolution of major ampullate spidroin genes, whereas silk protein diversity in tarantula is far less complex. The difference in silk proteins between species is consistent with a more complex silk gland morpholgy and use of three-dimentional capture webs consisting of multiple silk types in aranomorph spiders.","publicationDate":"2014-05-01","submissionType":"COMPLETE","numAssays":35,"species":["Acanthoscurria geniculata","Stegodyphus mimosarum"],"tissues":["thorax","venom","silk gland","whole body"],"ptmNames":["iodoacetamide derivatized residue","monohydroxylated residue","S-carboxamidoethyl-L-cysteine"],"instrumentNames":["instrument model","TripleTOF 5600"],"projectTags":["Biological"],"doi":"10.6019/PXD000318","submitter":{"title":"Dr","firstName":"Kristian","lastName":"Wejse Sanggaard","email":"kws@mbg.au.dk","affiliation":"Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics"},"labHeads":[],"submissionDate":"2013-07-02","reanalysis":null,"experimentTypes":["Bottom-up proteomics"],"quantificationMethods":[],"keywords":"genomics, system biology, proteomics, transcriptomics, zoology, venomics","sampleProcessingProtocol":"Not available","dataProcessingProtocol":"Not available","otherOmicsLink":null,"numProteins":10831,"numPeptides":293064,"numSpectra":3327014,"numUniquePeptides":42189,"numIdentifiedSpectra":245376,"references":[{"desc":"Sanggaard KW, Bechsgaard JS, Fang X, Duan J, Dyrlund TF, Gupta V, Jiang X, Cheng L, Fan D, Feng Y, Han L, Huang Z, Wu Z, Liao L, Settepani V, Thøgersen IB, Vanthournout B, Wang T, Zhu Y, Funch P, Enghild JJ, Schauser L, Andersen SU, Villesen P, Schierup MH, Bilde T, Wang J.

Loss of VHL in renal tumors also differs from tumors of other organs in that the oncogenic cascade is mediated by an increase in the levels of hypoxia-inducible factor-2alpha (HIF2alpha) instead of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF1alpha).        MS/MS data generated by data dependent acquisition via the LTQ-FT were extracted by BioWorks version 3.3 and searched against a composite IPI human protein sequence database (IPI _human_v 3.73.par)  containing both forward and randomized sequences using Mascot version 2.2 (Matrix Science, Boston, MA) search algorithm. Mascot was searched with a fragment ion mass tolerance of 0.80 Da and a parent ion tolerance of 15.0 ppm assuming trypsin as the digestion enzyme with the possibility of one missed cleavage. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was specified as a fixed modification, while oxidation of methionine, N-terminal protein acetylation, N-terminal peptide and lysine carbamoylation, and phosphorylation of serine and threonine were specified as variable modifications. The analysis of VHL-wt (Caki-2) human RCC and VHL-mut (786-O) cells was carried out from three independent, biological samples from each cell line (tryptic digests of Caki-2 and 786-O, respectively) and duplicate injections were made for each sample. Data processing was accomplished using two software tools: Scaffold (version Scaffold 3.0, Proteome Software Inc., Portland, OR) and Progenesis LC-MS (version 3.0, Nonlinear Dynamics, Durham, NC). Scaffold was employed to validate MS/MS-based peptide and protein identifications from Mascot database searching. Initial peptide identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 95% probability as specified by the Peptide Prophet algorithm [20]. Protein probabilities were assigned by the Protein Prophet algorithm [21]. Protein identifications were accepted, if they reached greater than 99% probability and contained at least 2 identified unique peptides. These identification criteria typically established < 0.01% false discovery rate based on a decoy database search strategy at the protein level.        Extracted peptide intensities were evaluated with Progenesis LC-MS to obtain label-free relative quantification from the raw data files. The software created a single aggregate run based on LC retention time of each analysis to contain all MS data with distinguished peptide ions and, then, further feature outline maps were generated for detection and quantification of peptide ions from individual analyses using default program parameters. Peptide quantifications were performed by summing peak intensities followed by normalization, data filtering to retain only ions with positive charges (z) of two and three, and exporting peak lists to query against the IPI human protein sequence database using Mascot (see Database Search subsection above). Proteins were accepted as differentially expressed following analysis of variance (ANOVA, P<0.05), requiring at least a twofold change in expression and also passing validation by Peptide Prophet and Protein Prophet using protein identifications from Scaffold.","publicationDate":"2013-08-11","submissionType":"COMPLETE","numAssays":12,"species":["Homo sapiens (Human)"],"tissues":[],"ptmNames":["iodoacetamide derivatized residue","monohydroxylated residue"],"instrumentNames":["instrument model"],"projectTags":[],"doi":"10.6019/PXD000335","submitter":{"title":"Professor","firstName":"Laszlo","lastName":"Prokai","email":"advancedms@unthsc.edu","affiliation":"Department of Pharmacology & Neuroscience\r\nUNT Health Science Center\r\nFort Worth, TX, USA"},"labHeads":[],"submissionDate":"2013-07-10","reanalysis":null,"experimentTypes":["Bottom-up proteomics"],"quantificationMethods":[],"keywords":"Human, VHL, Cancer, HIF-2a, LC-MS/MS","sampleProcessingProtocol":"Not available","dataProcessingProtocol":"Not available","otherOmicsLink":null,"numProteins":4432,"numPeptides":22745,"numSpectra":102844,"numUniquePeptides":8323,"numIdentifiedSpectra":12685,"references":[{"desc":"Nagaprashantha LD, Talamantes T, Singhal J, Guo J, Vatsyayan R, Rauniyar N, Awasthi S, Singhal SS, Prokai L; Proteomic analysis of signaling network regulation in renal cell carcinomas with differential hypoxia-inducible factor-2α expression., PLoS One, 2013, 8, 8, e71654, ","ids":["PMID:23940778","DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0071654"]}]}

In arthropods, Wolbachia can induce reproductive alterations and interfere with the transmission of several arthropod-borne pathogens. Additionally, Wolbachia is an obligate mutualist of the filarial parasites that cause lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis in the tropics. Targeting Wolbachia with tetracycline antibiotics leads to sterilisation and ultimately death of adult filariae. However, several weeks of treatment are required, restricting the implementation of this control strategy. To date, the response of Wolbachia to stress has not been investigated and almost nothing is known about global regulation of gene expression in this organism. We exposed an arthropod Wolbachia strain to doxycycline in vitro, and analysed differential expression by directional RNA-seq and label-free, quantitative proteomics. For proteomic analysis, Wolbachia-enriched material was purified further using additional filtration and Percoll gradients. Proteins were solubilised by sonication in a MS safe detergent, reduced with dithiothreitol and alkylated with iodoacetamide. Proteomic grade trypsin was added at a protein:trypsin ratio of 50:1, and samples were incubated at 37 C overnight prior to removal of detergent by trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) precipitation. Peptide mixtures were analysed by nano LC-MSMS using a LTQ-Orbitrap Velos (ThermoFisher Scientific). In one control sample, peptides were fractionated by strong anion exchange (SAX) using commercially available SAX spin filters (Thermo Scientific). Data was imported into Progenesis LC-MS (Nonlinear Dynamics) and runs were time-aligned using default settings. Peaks were picked by the software. Peptide intensities were normalised against an auto-selected reference run and differences in protein expression and associated ANOVA P-values between seven control and nine doxycycline-treated biological replicates were calculated by Progenesis LC-MS. Spectral data were transformed to MGF files with Progenesis LC-MS and exported for peptide identification using the Mascot search engine (Matrix Science).

Magnetosome biogenesis was recently found to be controlled by a large set of genes clustered within a genomic magnetosome island. The unprecedented structural and magnetic properties of magnetosomes and the difficulties to cultivate and manipulate the fastidious bacteria have stimulated ideas to express the underlying biosynthesis pathway in more amenable hosts. However, this has remained an unsolved challenge, owing to the structural complexity of the magnetosome organelle, the insufficient knowledge of involved gene functions, and the challenge to balance expression of numerous proteins. Here we show that the entire gene set required for magnetosome biogenesis can be functionally expressed in the model organism Rhodospirillum rubrum, thereby converting it into a synthetic magnetotactic and phototrophic bacterium. Modular transfer of various cassettes comprising the 30 mam and mms genes that were stitched together by recombinogenic cloning was required and sufficient for biogenesis of magnetosome chains in R. rubrum. However, further auxiliary functions encoded outside these clusters were necessary for biosynthesis of fully developed magnetosomes. Our results for the first time demonstrate that the synthesis of one of the most complex prokaryotic structures can be fully reconstituted within a foreign, hitherto nonmagnetic host. We provide first experimental evidence that the magnetotactic trait can be transmitted horizontally to different species by single or few events of transfer. Conceivably, our findings may enable future synthetic biology approaches for the endogenous production of tailored magnetic nanoparticles within both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, which will be useful for various biotechnological and biomedical applications.

The resulting tryptic peptides were collected by centrifugation and the filter were washed twice with 50 uL of 50 mM ABC. Eluted peptides were acidified with 10 uL of formic acid and cleaned up on a homemade Empore C18 column (3M, St. Paul, MN, USA) (ref) for subsequent phospho-enrichment and/or analysis by LC-MS/MS. The dried protein digest was dissolved with 10 uL (3 % ACN, 0.1 % TFA), diluted 1:5 with loading buffer (1 M glycolic acid, 5 % TFA, 80 % ACN) and phosphopeptides were enriched on TiO2-beads as previously described (19). Briefly 5 mg of \"Titansphere TiO2 5 um\" were suspended in 100 uL of 100 % ACN, immobilized in a pipette-column and washed using 5 uL of loading buffer. Each sample was loaded in each pipette-column and then washed with 30 uL of washing buffer (1 % TFA, 80 % ACN). Phosphopeptides were eluted from the beads with 25 uL of 25 % ACN (v/v) containing 25 % NH4OH (m/v), acidified with 10 uL of 10 % TFA and vacuum- concentrated to approximately 4 uL. Samples were finally diluted to 10 uL with H2O + 0.1% formic acid prior to injection.  The peptides mixtures were analyzed by online nanoflow liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS/MS) on an EASY-nLC system (Proxeon Biosystems, Odense, Denmark) connected to the LTQ Orbitrap Velos instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) through a nanoelectrospray ion source. Six microliters of the peptide mixture were auto-sampled directly onto the analytical HPLC column (120 mm x75 um I.D., 3 um particle size (Nikkyo Technos Co., Ltd.) with a 120-min gradient from 5 % to 50 % ACN in 0.1 % FA. The effluent from the HPLC column was directly electrosprayed into the mass spectrometer.  The LTQ Orbitrap Velos instrument was operated in data-dependent acquisition mode to automatically switch between full scan MS and MS/MS acquisition. The MS survey scan was performed in the FT cell recording a window between 350 and 2000 m/z. The resolution was set to 60 000, and the automatic gain control was set to 1,000,000 ions with a maximal acquisition time of 400 ms. The 20 most intense peptide ions with charge states great than or equal to 2 were sequentially isolated to a target value of 5,000 and fragmented in the high-pressure linear ion trap by low-energy CID with normalized collision energy of 35% Q value of 0.25, and an activation time of 10 ms. Raw files were processed using Proteome Discoverer version 1.3 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen). Peak lists were searched using Mascot software version 2.3 (Matrix Science, UK) against a SwissProt database containing entries corresponding to Rattus norvegicus (version of July 2012), a list of common contaminants, and all the corresponding decoy entries. Trypsin was chosen as enzyme and a maximum of two miscleavages were allowed. Carbamidomethylation (C) was set as a fixed modification, whereas oxidation (M) and phosphorylation (STY) were used as variable modifications. Searches were performed using a peptide tolerance of 7 ppm, a product ion tolerance of 0.5 Da. Resulting data files were filtered for FDR less than 1 % at peptide level.","publicationDate":"2014-02-14","submissionType":"COMPLETE","numAssays":20,"species":["Rattus norvegicus (Rat)"],"tissues":["cardiac muscle"],"ptmNames":[],"instrumentNames":["instrument model"],"projectTags":["PRIME-XS Project"],"doi":"10.6019/PXD000354","submitter":{"title":"Mr","firstName":"Francesco Mattia","lastName":"Mancuso","email":"francescomattia.mancuso@gmail.com","affiliation":"CRG/UPF Proteomics Unit"},"labHeads":[],"submissionDate":"2013-07-21","reanalysis":null,"experimentTypes":["Bottom-up proteomics"],"quantificationMethods":[],"keywords":"Rat, cardiac muscle, LC-MSMS, FASP, phosphoproteome, mithocondria","sampleProcessingProtocol":"Not available","dataProcessingProtocol":"Not available","otherOmicsLink":null,"numProteins":8438,"numPeptides":51272,"numSpectra":356030,"numUniquePeptides":24340,"numIdentifiedSpectra":39922,"references":[{"desc":"Ferreira R, Vitorino R, Padrao AI, Espadas G, Mancuso FM, Moreira-Gonçalves D, Castro-Sousa G, Henriques-Coelho T, Oliveira PA, Barros AS, Duarte JA, Sabidó E, Amado F.

{"accession":"PXD000375","title":"Global analysis of Cdc14 dephosphorylation sites reveals essential regulatory role in mitosis and cytokinesis","projectDescription":"Degradation of the M phase cyclins triggers the exit from M phase. Cdc14 is the major phosphatase required for the exit of the M phase. One of the functions of Cdc14 is to dephosphorylate and activate the Cdh1/APC/C complex, resulting in the degradation of the M phase cyclins. However, other crucial targets of Cdc14 for mitosis and cytokinesis remain to be elucidated. Here we systematically analyzed the positions of dephosphorylation sites for the Cdc14 in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Quantitative mass spectrometry identified a total of 835 dephosphorylation sites on 455 potential Cdc14 substrates in vivo. We validated two events and functional studies discovered that Cdc14-mediated dephosphorylation of Smc4 and Bud3 is essential for proper mitosis and cytokinesis, respectively. These results provide insight into the Cdc14-mediated pathways for exiting of M phase. Database Search: Raw MS/MS data from the LTQ-Orbitrap were transformed to msm-files using the software RAW2MSM (version 1.1.) (1). The msm-files were searched using Mascot (version 2.2.1) against the Swisssprot_Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker's yeast) database (version 54.2, 6493 sequences) with the following exceptions: only tryptic peptides with up to two missed cleavage sites were allowed, the fragment ion mass tolerance was set at 10 ppm, and the parent ion tolerance at 0.6 Da. Phosphorylation (STY) and oxidation(M) were specified as variable modifications. Peptides were considered identified if their Mascot individual ion score was higher than 20(p< 0.05). The false discovery rates for Orbitrap data were determined with Mascot score >20 (p< 0.05) in this study. Quantitative Analysis by IDEAL-Q: The quantitative analysis of phosphopeptide was performed by the SEMI label free algorithm and IDEAL-Q software. The raw data files acquired from the LTQ-Orbitrap were converted into files of mzXML format by the program ReAdW (XCalibur, Thermo Finnigan), and the search results in MASCOT were exported in eXtensive Markup Language data (.XML) format. After data conversion, the confident peptide identification results (p < 0.05) from each LC-MS/MS run were loaded and merged to establish a global peptide information list (sequence, elution time and mass-to-charge). Alignment of elution time was then performed based on the peptide information list using linear regression in different LC-MS/MS runs followed by correction of aberrational chromatographic shift across fragmental elution-time domains. To increase correct assignment, the detected peptide peaks were validated by the SCI validation using the three criteria: (a) signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio > 3, (b) accurate charge state and (c) correct isotope pattern. To calculate relative peptide abundance, the tool performs reconstruction of extracted ion chromatography (XIC), and calculation of XIC area. The fold-change of a given peptide was calculated by the ratio of relative peptide abundance between different samples. Finally, the quantitation result of each phosphopeptide was manually checked.","publicationDate":"2013-12-10","submissionType":"COMPLETE","numAssays":9,"species":["Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker's yeast)"],"tissues":["cell culture"],"ptmNames":["phosphorylated residue","monohydroxylated residue"],"instrumentNames":["LTQ Orbitrap","instrument model"],"projectTags":["Biological"],"doi":"10.6019/PXD000375","submitter":{"title":"Mr","firstName":"Chia-Feng","lastName":"Tsai","email":"grazzilybear@gmail.com","affiliation":"Institute of Chemistry"},"labHeads":[],"submissionDate":"2013-07-28","reanalysis":null,"experimentTypes":["Bottom-up proteomics"],"quantificationMethods":[],"keywords":"yeast, phosphoproteome, CDC14","sampleProcessingProtocol":"Not available","dataProcessingProtocol":"Not available","otherOmicsLink":null,"numProteins":11921,"numPeptides":42357,"numSpectra":84787,"numUniquePeptides":29106,"numIdentifiedSpectra":34282,"references":[{"desc":"Kao L, Wang YT, Chen YC, Tseng SF, Jhang JC, Chen YJ, Teng SC.

Functional conservation of a timekeeping function for CK1 in the green lineage was recently identified in the green marine unicell Ostreococcus tauri, in spite of the absence of CK1's transcriptional targets known from other species. The short-period phenotype of CK1tau mutant in mammals depends specifically on increased CK1 activity against PERIOD proteins. To understand how CK1 acts differently upon the algal clock, we analysed the effect of CK1tau overexpression on the phospho-preoteome of O. tauri using label-free quantification compared to the parent line.  Ostreococcus tauri cells were harvested, trypsinised and phosphopeptide enrichment was performed using TiO2 columns followed by LC-MS separation (140minute gradient) on a Orbitrap XL.

Currently, little is known about the molecular pathogenesis and no direct genotype-phenotype relationship has yet been confirmed. Since DS amniocytes are expected to have a distinct biological behaviour compared to normal amniocytes, we hypothesise that relative quantification of proteins produced from trisomy and euploid (chromosomally normal) amniocytes will reveal dysregulated molecular pathways. Chromosomally normal- and Trisomy 21-amniocytes were quantitatively analyzed by using Stable Isotope Labeling of Amino acids in Cell culture and tandem mass spectrometry. The most extensive proteome of amniocytes and amniotic fluid has been generated and differentially expressed proteins from amniocytes with Trisomy 21 revealed molecular pathways that seem to be most significantly affected by the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 21. Mass spectra were analyzed using Mascot (version 2.2, Matrix Science), executing a spectral search against a concatenated International Protein Index (IPI) human protein database (version 3.54 containing 39,925 entries) and a decoy database.

{"accession":"PXD000387","title":"LC-MS/MS of gingiva and Periodontal ligaments","projectDescription":"Background: Although human gingival fibroblasts (hGF) and human periodontal ligament fibroblasts (hPDLF) exhibit numerous phenotypic similarities, it has been suggested that the secretory and behavioral differences, which exist between these cell types, are a result of the membrane protein composition of these cells.        Methods: Four matched pairs of hGF and hPDLF were cultured.  Prior to confluence, membrane bound and associated proteins from cells of the 4th passage were extracted.  The processed protein samples were identified by digestion with trypsin and sequenced using capillary-liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry on an Thermo Scientific LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer.  Scaffold by Proteome Software was used to quantitate and validate protein identifications derived from MS/MS sequencing results.        Results: Four hundred fifty proteins were common to both hGF and hPDLF.  Of the proteins identified, 214 were known membrane bound or associated proteins and 165 proteins were known nuclear associated proteins. Twenty-seven proteins, identified from the 450 proteins, common to both hGF and hPDLF, were detected in statistically significant greater quantities in either hGF or hPDLF.  More specifically, 13 proteins were detected in significantly greater quantities in hGF, while 14 proteins were detected in significantly greater quantities in hPDLF.        Conclusions:  Distinct differences in the cellular protein catalog may reflect the dynamic role and high energy requirements of hGF in extracellular matrix remodeling and response to inflammatory challenge as well as the role of hPDGF in monitoring mechanical stress and maintaining tissue homeostasis during regeneration and remineralization.        Method Details: Sequence information from the MS/MS data was processed by converting the .raw files into a merged file (.mgf) using an in-house program, RAW2MZXML_n_MGF_batch (merge.pl, a Perl script).  Isotope distributions for the precursor ions of the MS/MS spectra were deconvoluted to obtain the charge states and monoisotopic m/z values of the precursor ions during the data conversion. The resulting mgf files were searched using Mascot Daemon by Matrix Science version 2.3.2 (Boston, MA) and the database searched against the full SwissProt database version 2012_06 (536,489 sequences; 190,389,898 residues) or NCBI database version 20120515 (18,099,548 sequences; 6,208,559,787 residues The mass accuracy of the precursor ions were set to 20ppm, accidental pick of 13C peaks was also included into the search. The fragment mass tolerance was set to 0.5 Da.  Considered variable modifications were oxidation (Met), deamidation (N and Q) and carbamidomethylation (Cys). Four missed cleavages for the enzyme were permitted.  A decoy database was also searched to determine the false discovery rate (FDR) and peptides were filtered according to the FDR. The significance threshold was set at p less than 0.05 and bold red peptides is required for valid peptide identification. Proteins with a Mascot score of 50 or higher with a minimum of two unique peptides from one protein having a -b or -y ion sequence tag of five residues or better were accepted. Any modifications or low score peptide/protein identifications were manually checked for validation.         Spectral Counting: Label Free Quantitation was performed using the spectral counting approach. Scaffold (version Scaffold_3.4.9, Proteome Software Inc., Portland, OR) was used to validate MS/MS based peptide and protein identifications. Peptide identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 95.0% probability as specified by the Peptide Prophet algorithm (Keller, A et al Anal. Chem. 2002;74(20):5383-92).  Protein identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 95.0% probability and contained at least 1 identified peptides.  Protein probabilities were assigned by the Protein Prophet algorithm (Nesvizhskii, AI Anal Chem. 2003 Sep 1;75(17):4646-58).

{"accession":"PXD000403","title":"Sphingomonas wittichii RW1 shotgun proteomics","projectDescription":"Chlorinated congeners of dibenzo-p-dioxin and dibenzofuran are widely dispersed pollutants that can be treated using microorganisms, such as the Sphingomonas wittichii RW1 bacterium, able to transform some of them into non-toxic substances. The enzymes of the upper pathway for dibenzo-p-dioxin degradation in S. wittichii RW1 have been biochemically and genetically characterized, but its genome sequence has indicated the existence of a tremendous potential for aromatic compound transformation, with 56 ring-hydroxylating dioxygenase subunits, 34 extradiol dioxygenases, and 40 hydrolases. To further characterize this enzymatic arsenal, new methodological approaches should be employed. Here, a large shotgun proteomic survey has been performed on cells grown on dibenzofuran, dibenzo-p-dioxin, and 2-chlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, and compared to growth on acetate. Changes in the proteome were monitored over time.        Peak lists were generated with the Mascot Daemon software (version 2.3.2; Matrix Science, London, UK) using the extract_msn.exe data import filter (Thermo Fisher Scientific) from the Xcalibur FT package (version 2.0.7; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Data import filter options were set to 400 (minimum mass), 5000 (maximum mass), 0 (grouping tolerance), 0 (intermediate scans) and 1000 (threshold). The mgf files from technical triplicates were merged, and MS/MS spectra were assigned using the Mascot Daemon 2.3.2 (Matrix Science) and a database containing the nonredundant RefSeq protein entries for S. wittichii RW1 (NCBI Taxonomy ID: 392499), comprising 5345 protein sequences totalling 1 800 684 amino acids. The search was performed using the following criteria: tryptic peptides with a maximum of two miscleavages, mass tolerances of 5 ppm on the parent ion and 0.5 Da on the MS/MS, fixed modification for carbamidomethylated cysteine, and variable modification for methionine oxidation. Mascot results were parsed using the IRMa 1.28.0 software. Peptides were identified with a P-value threshold below 0.05.

{"accession":"PXD000411","title":"Proteomics of protein secretion by Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans","projectDescription":"Background.  Periodontal diseases are bacterial-induced inflammatory diseases of the tooth-supporting tissues. Periodontitis is epidemiologically associated with systemic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and cardiovascular diseases. Secreted bacterial products and virulence factors are considered to link periodontitis and systemic diseases. As one of the most studied organisms in periodontal diseases, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans serves as model organism to study the secretion of bacterial products and virulence factors into host tissues. We applied bioinformatics and proteomics to define the virulence potential of the secretome of the A. actinomycetemcomitans strain D7S. Results. The genome of A. actinomycetemcomitans (EBI: ADCF01000001) shows the presence of the Sec and Tat secretion systems, and their activity was confirmed by the detection of specific substrates in the fractions of secreted proteins. Two preparations of secreted proteins were analyzed and 103 proteins were identified that were present in both preparations. Among the proteins that have a known pathogenic potential in in vitro studies are the outer membrane proteins Omp100, Omp64, Omp39, Omp16/18 and OmpA, and the leukotoxin, CdT. In addition, the secretome of A. actinomycetemcomitans revealed candidates for novel virulence factors. Most strikingly, these proteins included the lipoprotein LppC and a homologue to the factor H-binding protein (fHbp) of Neisseria spp. Furthermore, in our in silico approach VacJ, OapA, OapB and an uncharacterized protein were identified. Conclusions.The secretome of A. actinomycetemcomitans gives an overview of the pathogenic potential of this bacterium including established virulence factors and putative novel ones such as LppC and fHbp.   Methods  Bacterial strain and growth conditions A. actinomycetemcomitans serotype a rough-colony strain D7S was isolated from a patient suffering aggressive periodontal disease [1] and used in this study. The strain was cultured on blood agar plates (5% defibrinated horse blood, 5 mg hemin/l, 10 mg Vitamin K/l, Columbia agar base) incubated in air supplemented with 5% CO2, at 37 C for 3 d as previously described [2]. For biofilm growth, 2 - 108 bacterial cells were inoculated in 2 ml tryptic soy broth (Difco) in 24-well cell culture plates (Nunc), which were incubated in static culture in air supplemented with 5% CO2, at 37C for 42 h.  Preparation of the D7S secretome Following biofilm cultivation, 2 ml of the growth medium of a single well was carefully collected and then centrifuged for 10 min at 10.000 x g to pellet down remaining bacterial cells. Supernatants were then filtered through 0.45 um and subsequently 0.22 um membranes prior to being desalted and concentrated into 120 ul H2O with Pall 10K membrane filters according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pall Corporation).  SDS-PAGE and preparation of in-gel digests For mass-spectrometry, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE in 12% polyacrylamide gels (length 12 cm, thickness 1.5 mm) [3] containing 0.78% N,N'-methylenbisacrylamide and 2M urea. Subsequent to electrophoresis the gels were fixated using 10% acetic acid, 30% ethanol and stained using hot Coomassie blue [4]. Preparations of peptides for analysis by mass spectrometry were generated essentially as described earlier [5].  Mass-spectrometry and MS/MS data processing LC-MS/MS analysis of peptides was performed using an HCT-Ultra ETD II ion trap mass spectrometer from Bruker (Bremen, Germany) linked to an Easy-nLC system from Proxeon (Odense, Denmark). Spectra were acquired using the enhanced scanning mode covering a mass range from m/z 400 to m/z 1300. The LC separation of peptides was performed using a 5 ?m C18 column (375 um OD/75 um IDx10 cm) from NanoSeparations (Nieuwkoop, The Netherlands) and a 60 min gradient ranging from 1 to 50 percent of acetonitrile. The solvents used were 0.1% formic acid from Baker (Tamro AB, Hisings Backa, Sweden) in 18 MOhm water (Millipore, Solna, Sweden) and 0.1% formic acid in acetoinitrile (LiChrosolv) from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany), and the flow rate was 300 nl min-1. In this study, each of the two independent preparations of secreted proteins of A. actinomycetemcomitans (strain D7S) used, were analyzed two times. The LC-MS/MS datasets were processed using Bruker DataAnalysis 4.0 SP4 using default settings for deconvolution and compound detection. Database searches using the peaklist files of the processed mass spectra were performed in the bacterial section of the NCBInr database using ProteinSacpe 2.1 (Bruker) and in-house licenses of Mascot 2.3.01 (www.matrixscience.com) and of Phenyx 2.6 (www.genbio.com). The search parameters allowed for one missed cleavage site and a mass error of 0.3 Da for both the MS and MS/MS mode. In addition, variable modifications including methionine oxidation, N-terminal acetylation, and derivation of cysteine by propionamide were considered. Non-redundant protein lists were obtained using the ProteinExtractor of ProteinScape 2.1 and settings for spectra acceptance as follows: Mascot score greater than 100 and at least one peptide with a peptide ion score greater than55. Peptides with a Mascot ion score less than 30 were ignored. As for Phenyx scores, the minimum threshold for protein acceptance was 18 and at least one peptide with a score of 10 as required. Peptides with a Phenyx score less than 7 were not considered. As ProteinScape considers different modified forms of the same peptide as individual peptides, all protein identifications on the final result list were manually inspected to ensure that each protein identification was based on at least two peptides with different sequences.","publicationDate":"2013-08-12","submissionType":"COMPLETE","numAssays":4,"species":["Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans D7S-1"],"tissues":[],"ptmNames":["monohydroxylated residue","S-carboxamidoethyl-L-cysteine","acetylated residue"],"instrumentNames":["Bruker Daltonics HCT Series","instrument model"],"projectTags":[],"doi":"10.6019/PXD000411","submitter":{"title":"Dr","firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Kieselbach","email":"thomas.kieselbach@chem.umu.se","affiliation":"Biochemistry"},"labHeads":[],"submissionDate":"2013-08-12","reanalysis":null,"experimentTypes":["Bottom-up proteomics"],"quantificationMethods":[],"keywords":"Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, secreted protein, pathogene","sampleProcessingProtocol":"Not available","dataProcessingProtocol":"Not available","otherOmicsLink":null,"numProteins":1016,"numPeptides":2821,"numSpectra":378841,"numUniquePeptides":1356,"numIdentifiedSpectra":2821,"references":[{"desc":"Zijnge V, Kieselbach T, Oscarsson J; Proteomics of protein secretion by Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans., PLoS One, 2012, 7, 7, e41662, ","ids":["DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0041662","PMID:22848560"]}]}
{"accession":"PXD000412","title":"Human dental calculus LC-MS/MS","projectDescription":"The purpose of this study was to investigate oral microbiome and host proteins in archaeological human dental tissues using a shotgun proteomics approach. The research focuses on dental calculus (mineralized plaque), dentine, a carious lesion, and an alveolar bone abscess from the medieval site of Dalheim, Germany (ca. AD 950-1200). For comparison, proteins were also analyzed from archaeological faunal dental tissues and human dental calculus samples from modern Swiss dental patient controls. Protein extraction and generation of tryptic peptides from tooth and dental calculus specimens was performed using a filter-aided sample preparation (FASP) protocol, modified for mineralized and degraded samples. Total protein extraction was performed on a total of fourteen samples: four ancient human calculus samples (indicated as: G12, B71, B61, and B78), four ancient human tooth root samples (indicated as: G12, B17, B61, and B78), one carious lesion (indicated as: B17), one alveolar bone abscess (indicated as: B17), two ancient fauna crown cementum/calculus samples (indicated as: F1 [sheep] and F5 [cattle]), and two modern dental calculus samples from clinical patients (indicated as: P1 and P2). All samples were extracted at the Centre for Evolutionary Medicine (ZEM) at the University of Zürich with the exception of dental calculus from G12, P1, and P2, which were extracted at the Center for GeoGenetics (CGG) at the University of Copenhagen.

LTQ-Orbitrap Velos (FGCZ): Samples were analyzed on an LTQ-Orbitrap VELOS mass spectrometer (Thermo Fischer Scientific, Bremen, Germany) coupled to an Eksigent-NanoLC-Ultra 1D plus HPLC system (Eksigent Technologies, Dublin (CA), USA). Solvent composition at the two channels was 0.2% formic acid, 1% acetonitrile for channel A and 0.2% formic acid, 100% acetonitrile for channel B. Peptides were loaded on a self-made tip column (75 µm × 80 mm) packed with reverse phase C18 material (AQ, 3 μm 200 Å, Bischoff GmbH, Leonberg, Germany) and eluted with a flow rate of 250 nl per min by a gradient from 0.8% to 4.8% of B in 2 min, 35% B at 57 min, 48% B at 60 min, 97% at 65 min. Full-scan MS spectra (300−1700 m/z) were acquired in the Orbitrap with a resolution of 30 000 at 400 m/z after accumulation to a target value of 1,000, 000. Higher energy collision induced dissociation (HCD) MS/MS spectra were recorded in data dependent manner in the Orbitrap with a resolution of 7500 at 400 m/z after accumulation to a target value of 100, 000. Precursors were isolated from the ten most intense signals above a threshold of 500 arbitrary units with an isolation window of 2 Da. Three collision energy steps were applied with a step width of 15.0% around a normalized collision energy of 40% and an activation time of 0.1 ms. Charge state screening was enabled excluding non-charge state assigned and singly charged ions from MS/MS experiments. Precursor masses already selected for MS/MS were excluded for further selection for 45 s with an exclusion window of 20 ppm. The size of the exclusion list was set to a maximum of 500 entries. Q-Exactive Hybrid Quadrupole Orbitrap (CPR): The LC-MS system consisted of an EASY-nLC™system (Thermo Scientific, Odense, Denmark) connected to the Q-Exactive (Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany) through a nano electrospray ion source. 5 uL of each peptide sample was auto-sampled onto and directly separated in a 15cm analytical column (75 μm inner diameter) in-house packed with 3μm C18 beads (Reprosil-AQ Pur, Dr. Maisch) with a 130 minute linear gradient from 5% to 26% acetonitrile followed by a steeper linear 20 minute gradient from 26% to 48% acetonitrile. Throughout the gradients a fixed concentration of 0.5% acetic acid and a flow rate of 250 nL/min were set. A final washout and column re-equilibration added an additional 15 minutes to each acquisition. The effluent from the HPLC was directly electrosprayed into the mass spectrometer by applying 2.0 kV through a platinum-based liquid-junction. The Q-Exactive was operated in data-dependent mode to automatically switch between full scan MS and MS/MS acquisition. Software control was Tune version 2.0-1428 and Excalibur version 2.2.42, and the settings were adjusted for ‘sensitive’ acquisition. Briefly, each full scan MS was followed by up to 10 MS/MS events. The isolation window was set at 1.6 Th and a dynamic exclusion of 90 seconds was used to avoid repeated sequencing. Only precursor charge states above 1 and below 6 were considered for fragmentation. A minimum intensity threshold for triggering fragment MS/MS was set at 1e5. Full scan MS were recorded at resolution of 70,000 at m/z 200 in a mass range of 300-1700 m/z with a target value of 1e6 and a maximum injection time of 20 ms. Fragment MS/MS were recorded with a fixed ion injection time set to 120 ms through a target value set to 1e6 and recorded at a resolution of 35,000 with a fixed first mass set to 100 m/z. MaXis UHR-Qq-TOF (PABL): The nanoLC system was interfaced with a maXis LC-MS/MS System (Bruker Daltonics) with a Bruker nano-electrospray source fitted with a steel emitter needle (180 µm O.D. x 30 µm I.D., Thermo [Proxeon]). Positive ESI- MS & MS/MS spectra were acquired using AutoMSMS mode. Instrument control, data acquisition and processing were performed using Compass 1.3 SR3 software (microTOF control, Hystar and DataAnalysis, Bruker Daltonics). Instrument settings were: ion spray voltage: 1,400 V, dry gas: 4 L/min, dry gas temperature 160°C, ion acquisition range: m/z 50-2,200. AutoMSMS settings were: MS: 0.5 s (acquisition of survey spectrum), MS/MS (CID with N2 as collision gas): ion acquisition range: m/z 300-1,500, 0.1 s acquisition for precursor intensities above 100,000 counts, for signals of lower intensities down to 1,000 counts acquisition time increased linear to 1s, the collision energy and isolation width settings were automatically calculated using the AutoMSMS fragmentation table: eight precursor ions, absolute threshold 1,000 counts, preferred charge states: 2–4, singly charged ions excluded. One MS/MS spectrum was acquired for each precursor, and former target ions were excluded for 30 s.","dataProcessingProtocol":"Tandem mass spectra were converted to the Mascot generic format (.mgf) using proteowizard version 2.2.3101 with the vendor peak picking option for MS level two. Corresponding .mgf files were further deisotoped and deconvoluted using the H-Scorer script. Mascot generic format MS/MS peak lists were submitted to Mascot (Matrix Science, London, UK; version 2.3.02) for searching. Selecting semi-trypsin as the proteolytic enzyme, Mascot was set up to search against a non-redundant, concatenated target/decoy protein database consisting of 4198561 forward and 4197958 reversed protein sequences that included all proteins available in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot (v.20121031; total 1076779 sequences), all proteins available in the Human Oral Microbiome Database as of 2012/10/11 (total 4476028 sequences; http://www.homd.org/), and all proteins available for Genbank genome accessions of bacteria and archaea in which the word “soil” appears in the metadata (total 2843972 sequences) as of 2012/02/22.

{"accession":"PXD000426","title":"Asn3 mass accuracy jurkat proteome","projectDescription":"The use of internal calibrants (the so called lock mass approach) provides much greater accuracy in mass spectrometry based proteomics. However, the polydimethylcyclosiloxane (PCM) peaks commonly used for this purpose are quite unreliable, leading to missing calibrant peaks in spectra and correspondingly lower mass measurement accuracy. Therefore, we here introduce a universally applicable and robust internal calibrant, the tripeptide Asn3. We show that Asn3 is a substantial improvement over PCM both in terms of consistent detection and resulting mass measurement accuracy. Asn3 is also very easy to adopt in the lab, as it requires only minor adjustments to the analytical setup. Data analysis: For mass measurement accuracy (MMA) calculations and comparisons, the following Mascot workflow was used. From the MS/MS data in each LC run, Mascot Generic Files were created using Distiller software (version 2.4.3.3, Matrix Science, London, UK, www.matrixscience.com/distiller.html). These peak lists were then searched with the Mascot search engine (Matrix Science) using the Mascot Daemon interface (version 2.4.0, Matrix Science). Spectra were searched against the Swiss-Prot database (version 13_04 of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot protein database containing 20,232 sequence entries of human proteins) concatenated with its reversed sequence database. Variable modifications were set to pyro-glutamate formation of amino terminal glutamine and acetylation of the protein N-terminus, whereas fixed modifications only included oxidation of methionine. Mass tolerance on peptide ions was set to 10 ppm (with Mascot’s C13 option set to 1), and the mass tolerance on peptide fragment ions was set to 20 millimass units (mmu), except for the space-charge effect experiment(LMA5)  where an extra search was done with a setting of 3 mmu. The peptide charge was set to 1+,2+,3+ and instrument setting was put on ESI-QUAD. Enzyme was set to trypsin allowing for one missed cleavage, and cleavage was allowed when arginine or lysine is followed by proline. Only peptides that were ranked one and scored above the threshold score, set at 99% confidence, were withheld. All data was processed and managed by ms_lims.","publicationDate":"2013-10-21","submissionType":"COMPLETE","numAssays":160,"species":["Homo sapiens (Human)"],"tissues":["cell culture"],"ptmNames":["deaminated residue","monohydroxylated residue","N-acetylated residue"],"instrumentNames":["LTQ Orbitrap Velos","instrument model"],"projectTags":["PRIME-XS Project"],"doi":"10.6019/PXD000426","submitter":{"title":"Mrs","firstName":"An","lastName":"Staes","email":"an.staes@vib-ugent.be","affiliation":"Medical Protein Chemistry"},"labHeads":[],"submissionDate":"2013-08-21","reanalysis":null,"experimentTypes":["Bottom-up proteomics"],"quantificationMethods":[],"keywords":"LC-MS/MS, human, mass accuracy, LTQ-Orbitrap Velos","sampleProcessingProtocol":"Not available","dataProcessingProtocol":"Not available","otherOmicsLink":null,"numProteins":60777,"numPeptides":103910,"numSpectra":457052,"numUniquePeptides":66623,"numIdentifiedSpectra":85224,"references":[{"desc":"Staes A, Vandenbussche J, Demol H, Goethals M, Yilmaz Ş, Hulstaert N, Degroeve S, Kelchtermans P, Martens L, Gevaert K.

{"accession":"PXD000429","title":"The Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida exoproteome.","projectDescription":"Background Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida, the etiologic agent of furunculosis, is a major pathogen of fisheries worldwide. Despite the identification of several virulence factors the pathogenesis is still poorly understood. We have used high-throughput proteomics to display the differences between in vitro secretome of A. salmonicida wild-type (wt, hypervirulent, JF5054) and T3SS-deficient (isogenic DeltaascV, extremely low-virulent, JF2747) strains in exponential (GP) and stationary (SP) phases of growth. Results Among the different experimental conditions we obtained semi-quantitative values for a total of 2136 A. salmonicida proteins. Proteins of specific A. salmonicida species were proportionally less detected than proteins common to the Aeromonas genus or those shared with other Aeromonas species, suggesting that in vitro growth did not induce the expression of these genes. Four detected proteins which are unidentified in the genome of reference strains of A. salmonicida were homologous to components of the conjugative T4SS of A. hydrophila pRA1 plasmid. Polypeptides of three proteins which are specific to the 01-B526 strain were also discovered. In supernatants (SNs), the number of detected proteins was higher in SP (326 for wt vs 329 for mutant) than in GP (275 for wt vs 263 for mutant). In pellets, the number of identified proteins (a total of 1536) was approximately the same between GP and SP. Numerous highly conserved cytoplasmic proteins were present in A. salmonicida SNs (mainly EF-Tu, EF-G, EF-P, EF-Ts, TypA, AlaS, ribosomal proteins, HtpG, DnaK, peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases, GAPDH, Enolase, FbaA, TpiA, Pgk, TktA, AckA, AcnB, Mdh, AhpC, Tpx, SodB and PNPase), and several evidences support the theory that their extracellular localization was not the result of cell lysis. According to the Cluster of Orthologous Groups classification, 29% of excreted proteins in A. salmonicida SNs were currently poorly characterized. Conclusions In this part of our work we elucidated the whole in vitro exoproteome of hypervirulent A. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida and showed the secretion of several highly conserved cytoplasmic proteins with putative moonlighting functions and roles in virulence. All together, our results offer new information about the pathogenesis of furunculosis and point out potential candidates for vaccine development.","publicationDate":"2013-11-11","submissionType":"COMPLETE","numAssays":8,"species":["Aeromonas salmonicida salmonicida"],"tissues":["stationary phase culture","growth phase culture"],"ptmNames":[],"instrumentNames":["instrument model"],"projectTags":["Biological"],"doi":"10.6019/PXD000429","submitter":{"title":"Dr","firstName":"Cedric","lastName":"Simillion","email":"cedric.simillion@telenet.be","affiliation":"DCR"},"labHeads":[],"submissionDate":"2013-08-22","reanalysis":null,"experimentTypes":["Bottom-up proteomics"],"quantificationMethods":[],"keywords":"Aeromonas salmonicia subsp. salmonicida, exoproteome, LC-MSMS, mutant, wild-type, pellet, supernatant","sampleProcessingProtocol":"Not available","dataProcessingProtocol":"Not available","otherOmicsLink":null,"numProteins":7066,"numPeptides":610434,"numSpectra":595786,"numUniquePeptides":70938,"numIdentifiedSpectra":593513,"references":[{"desc":"Vanden Bergh P, Heller M, Braga-Lagache S, Frey J; The Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida exoproteome: determination of the complete repertoire of Type-Three Secretion System effectors and identification of other virulence factors., Proteome Sci, 2013 Sep 27, 11, 1, 42, ","ids":["DOI:10.1186/1477-5956-11-42","PMID:24073886"]}]}

Since the underlying processes that govern pathogenicity and development in P. infestans are largely unknown, we have performed a large-scale phosphoproteomics study of six different P. infestans life stages. We have obtained quantitative data for 2922 phosphopeptides and compared their abundance in different life stages.        The samples were analysed on an LTQ Orbitrap XL ETD, operated in data dependent mode to automatically perform Orbitrap-MS and LTQ-MS/MS analysis.        The raw data from the Orbitrap was converted to .mgf files using ProteoWizard. The Proteios software environment was used to search the mgf files with Mascot version 2.3.01 against a database consisting of all P. infestans proteins in UniProt as of 2010-04-22, concatenated with an equal size decoy database (random protein sequences with conserved protein length and amino acid distribution, in total 36,512 target and decoy protein entries). Search tolerances were set to 7 ppm for MS and 0.5 Da for MS/MS. One missed cleavage was allowed. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues was selected as a fixed modification and oxidation of methionine residues and phosphorylation of serine, threonine and tyrosine residues were selected as variable modifications. Search results were exported from Mascot as XML, including query level results, with a modification to the export script to include protein accession numbers also for the query (spectrum) level results.

Principal component analysis clearly distinguished adenomas from normal mucosal samples, and cancer cell lines from HCEC cells. Two hundred twelve (212) proteins displayed significant expression changes in adenomatous tissues in comparison with normal mucosa samples (q-value < 0.02, mean fold change vs. normal mucosa  +/-1.4). These proteomic data showed correlation (r=0.7) with transcriptomic data from our previous studies. One-fourth of these proteins (51) had similar expression changes in colorectal cancer cells (vs. HCEC cells) and were therefore confidently attributed to the epithelial component of adenomas. Although benign, adenomas already displayed cancer-associated proteomic changes since the vast majority (91%) of the 76 upregulated proteins in these lesions have been previously reported in cancer. Validation studies were performed on one of the most significantly upregulated proteins, sorbitol dehydrogenase (SORD), a key enzyme in the polyol pathway. SORD concentrations and activity were dramatically increased in adenomas and cancer cell lines, where important changes were also noted in the expression of other enzymes in the same (AKR1B1) and related (KHK) pathways. Dysregulation of the polyol pathway may represent a novel aspect/facet of the metabolome remodelling associated with tumorigenesis.","otherOmicsLink":null,"numProteins":46338,"numPeptides":392879,"numSpectra":1497515,"numUniquePeptides":128139,"numIdentifiedSpectra":227708,"references":[{"desc":"Uzozie A, Nanni P, Staiano T, Grossmann J, Barkow-Oesterreicher S, Shay JW, Tiwari A, Buffoli F, Laczko E, Marra G.

{"accession":"PXD000450","title":"HLA-B40-peptidome","projectDescription":"HLA class I molecules bind peptides derived from the intracellular degradation of endogenous proteins and present them to cytotoxic T lymphocytes, allowing the immune system to detect transformed or virally infected cells. It is known that endogenous HLA class I associated peptides may harbor posttranslational modifications. In particular, phosphorylated ligands have raised much interest as potential targets for cancer immunotherapy. By combining affinity purification with high resolution mass spectrometry, we identified more than 2000 unique ligands associated to HLA-B40. Sequence analysis revealed two major anchor motifs: Aspartic or glutamic acid at peptide position 2 (P2) and methionine, phenylalanine or aliphatic residues at the C-terminus. The use of IMAC and TiO2 affinity chromatography allowed the characterization of 86 phosphorylated ligands. Every sequence belonging to this subset was further confirmed by comparing its experimental MS2 spectrum with that obtained upon fragmentation of the corresponding synthetic peptide. Remarkably, three of the identified phospholigands lacked a canonical anchor residue at P2 containing phosphoserine instead. Binding assays showed that this sort of peptides bound to HLA-B40 with high affinity probably due to the molecular mimicry between these residues. Altogether, our data demonstrate that the peptide repertoire of a given HLA allotype can be broadened by the presentation of peptides with posttranslational modifications at major anchor positions. We suggest that ligands with phosphorylated residues at P2 may be optimal targets for T-cell based cancer immunotherapy.","publicationDate":"2014-02-03","submissionType":"COMPLETE","numAssays":1,"species":["Homo sapiens (Human)"],"tissues":["C1R cell"],"ptmNames":["phosphorylated residue","deaminated residue","monohydroxylated residue"],"instrumentNames":["instrument model","TripleTOF 5600"],"projectTags":["Biology/Disease-Driven Human Proteome Project (B/D-HPP)","Human Proteome Project","Human Immuno-Peptidome Project (HUPO-HIPP)","Biomedical"],"doi":"10.6019/PXD000450","submitter":{"title":"Dr","firstName":"Miguel","lastName":"Marcilla","email":"mmarcilla@cnb.csic.es","affiliation":"Proteomics Unit - Dpt. of Macromolecular Structures - Spanish National Biotechnolgy Centre (CNB-CSIC)"},"labHeads":[],"submissionDate":"2013-09-03","reanalysis":null,"experimentTypes":["Bottom-up proteomics"],"quantificationMethods":[],"keywords":"peptidome, HLA, phosphopeptidome, HLA-B40,MHC","sampleProcessingProtocol":"Not available","dataProcessingProtocol":"Not available","otherOmicsLink":null,"numProteins":1821,"numPeptides":14368,"numSpectra":197847,"numUniquePeptides":2246,"numIdentifiedSpectra":13689,"references":[{"desc":"Marcilla M, Alpizar A, Lombardia M, Ramos-Fernandez A, Ramos M, Albar JP.

The 8-plex iTRAQ Multiplex Buffer Kit (AB SCIEX, Foster City, CA) was used to label different peptide fractions, in which iTRAQ reagents dissolved in isopropyl alcohol. Another internal standard of D.melanogaster body and head mixed with 1:1 (B+H) was also used when doing iTRAQ labeling. Therefore the same amount of B (body), H1 (head), H2 (head), B+H (internal standard) peptide fractions prepared as described above were labeled by equal but different iTRAQ reagents and incubated for 5 h at room temperature. The four different labeled peptide fractions (B:113, H1:114, H2:115, B+H:116 ) were then mixed with 1:1 and dried in a speedvac followed by desalting purification using stage tip.

A major focus of any therapeutic protein purification process is to reduce host cell proteins to an acceptable low level. In this study, various E. coli host cell proteins were identified at different purifications steps by HPLC fractionation, SDS-PAGE analysis, and tryptic peptide mapping combined with online liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS). However, no host cell proteins could be verified by direct LC-MS analysis of final drug substance material. In contrast, the application of affinity enrichment chromatography prior to comprehensive LC-MS was adequate to identify several low abundant host cell proteins at the final drug substance level. Bacterial alkaline phosphatase (BAP) was identified as being the most abundant host cell protein at several purification steps. Thus, we firstly established two different assays for enzymatic and immunological BAP monitoring using the cobas® technology. By using this strategy we were able to demonstrate an almost complete removal of BAP enzymatic activity by the established therapeutic protein purification process. In summary, the impact of fermentation, purification, and formulation conditions on host cell protein removal and biological activity can be conducted by monitoring process-specific host cell proteins in a GMP-compatible and high-throughput (> 1000 samples/day) manner.

The MS raw data files were converted to mzXML files using massWolf (version 4.3.1). The MS mzXML and MASCOT xml files were parsed and processed with a program developed in-house. Briefly, each scan was subjected to smoothing using Savitzky-Golay filtering (second order polynomial, five data points, two iterations) and peak areas were calculated after noise reduction. Peak mass was set to the average of the three highest data points for each peak. Unique peptides identified with MASCOT were matched to the parsed MS data using the parameters detected m/z, charge state and retention time, using a retention time window of ± 1.0 min. Charge states were calculated by using the first three isotopic peaks of a peptide and the same mass tolerances for detecting the mono isotopic peak as in the MASCOT search.","publicationDate":"2014-04-17","submissionType":"COMPLETE","numAssays":3,"species":["Populus tremula x Populus tremuloides"],"tissues":["vascular cambium"],"ptmNames":["iodoacetamide derivatized residue","monohydroxylated residue","acetylated residue"],"instrumentNames":["instrument model","Q-Tof ultima"],"projectTags":["Biological"],"doi":"10.6019/PXD000532","submitter":{"title":"Mr","firstName":"Joakim","lastName":"Bygdell","email":"Joakim.Bygdell@slu.se","affiliation":"Forest Genetics and Plant Physiology"},"labHeads":[],"submissionDate":"2013-10-20","reanalysis":null,"experimentTypes":["Bottom-up proteomics"],"quantificationMethods":[],"keywords":"cambium, superoxide dismutase, OnPLS, data integration","sampleProcessingProtocol":"Not available","dataProcessingProtocol":"Not available","otherOmicsLink":"UMA-0080","numProteins":948,"numPeptides":2387,"numSpectra":7191,"numUniquePeptides":1463,"numIdentifiedSpectra":1490,"references":[{"desc":"Srivastava V, Obudulu O, Bygdell J, Löfstedt T, Rydén P, Nilsson R, Ahnlund M, Johansson A, Jonsson P, Freyhult E, Qvarnström J, Karlsson J, Melzer M, Moritz T, Trygg J, Hvidsten TR, Wingsle G.

{"accession":"PXD000534","title":"Identification of novel biomarker candidates for the immunohistochemical diagnosis of cholangiocellular carcinoma - LC-MS Part","projectDescription":"The aim of this study was the identification of biomarkers for the immunohistochemical diagnosis of cholangiocellular carcinoma (CCC). CCC is a primary cancer which arises from the epithelial cells of the bile ducts and is characterised by high mortality rates due to its late clinical presentation and limited treatment options. Tumorous tissue and adjacent non-tumorous liver tissue from eight CCC patients were analysed by two-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) and by mass spectrometry-based label-free proteomics. After data analysis and statistical evaluation of the proteins which were found to be differentially regulated between the two experimental groups (fold change ≥ 1.5; p-value ≤ 0.05), 15 candidate proteins were chosen for verification by immunohistochemistry in an independent cohort of 14 patients. This confirmed the significant up-regulation of chloride intracellular channel protein 1 (CLIC1), gelsolin (GSN), pyruvate kinase isozymes M1/M2 (PKM2), serpin H1, 14-3-3 protein sigma (SFN), stress-induced phosphoprotein 1 (STIP1) and tax1-binding protein 3 (Tax1BP3) in tumorous cholangiocytes when compared to normal hepatocytes, whereas fatty acid-binding protein 1 (FABP1) and Betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase 1 (BHMT) were significantly down-regulated. Furthermore, STIP1 and SFN were able to differentiate between CCC tumour cells and non-tumorous cholangiocytes with a sensitivity of 100% and 86%, respectively and a specificity of 100% in both cases. We therefore conclude that these proteins should be considered as potential diagnostic biomarkers for CCC in an immunohistochemical application. Additional experiments addressing the validation of these novel biomarker candidates are being performed.","publicationDate":"2014-07-21","submissionType":"COMPLETE","numAssays":16,"species":["Homo sapiens (Human)"],"tissues":["cholangioma cell","liver"],"ptmNames":["oxidation","S-carboxamidoethyl-L-cysteine"],"instrumentNames":["LTQ Orbitrap","instrument model"],"projectTags":["Biomedical"],"doi":"10.6019/PXD000534","submitter":{"title":"Mr","firstName":"Julian","lastName":"Uszkoreit","email":"julian.uszkoreit@rub.de","affiliation":"Ruhr-Universität Bochum, Medizinisches Proteom-Center, Medical Bioinformatics, Algorithmic Proteomics"},"labHeads":[],"submissionDate":"2013-10-20","reanalysis":null,"experimentTypes":["Bottom-up proteomics"],"quantificationMethods":[],"keywords":"Human, Liver, Cholangiocellular Carcinoma, MALDI, LC-MS","sampleProcessingProtocol":"Not available","dataProcessingProtocol":"Not available","otherOmicsLink":null,"numProteins":50328,"numPeptides":341972,"numSpectra":500753,"numUniquePeptides":203986,"numIdentifiedSpectra":227470,"references":[{"desc":"Padden J, Megger DA, Bracht T, Reis H, Ahrens M, Kohl M, Eisenacher M, Schlaak JO, Canbay AE, Weber F, Hoffmann AC, Kuhlmann K, Meyer HE, Baba HA, Sitek B.

Using the MASCOT algorithm (Matrix Science, Version 2.4.0), the mgf files were searched against a decoy database containing normal and reverse sequences of the predicted SwissProt entries of mus musculus (www.ebi.ac.uk, release date 16/05/2012) and commonly observed contaminants (in total 33,832 sequences) generated using the SequenceReverser tool from the MaxQuant software (Version 1.0.13.13). The precursor ion tolerance was set to 10 ppm and fragment ion tolerance was set to 0.01 Da. The search criteria were set as follows: full tryptic specificity was required (cleavage after lysine or arginine residues unless followed by proline), 2 missed cleavages were allowed, carbamidomethylation (C), TMT6plex (K and peptide n-terminus) were set as fixed modification and oxidation (M) as a variable modification. Next, the database search results were imported to the Scaffold Q+ software (version 4.1.1, Proteome Software Inc., Portland, OR) and the protein false identification rate was set to 1% based on the number of decoy hits. Specifically, peptide identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 94.0% probability to achieve an FDR less than 1.0% by the scaffold local FDR algorithm. Protein identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 6.0% probability to achieve an FDR less than 1.0% and contained at least 1 identified peptide. Protein probabilities were assigned by the Protein Prophet program (Nesvizhskii, et al, Anal. Chem. 2003; 75(17):4646-58). Proteins that contained similar peptides and could not be differentiated based on MS/MS analysis alone were grouped to satisfy the principles of parsimony. Proteins sharing significant peptide evidence were grouped into clusters. For quantification, acquired reporter ion intensities in the experiment were globally normalized across all acquisition runs. Individual quantitative samples were normalized within each acquisition run. Intensities for each peptide identification were normalized within the assigned protein.

In this work, we investigated the effects of amino acid substitutions in the exosome subunit Rrp43p on the stability of the complex by comparing the interaction profiles of the complexes purified from the wild type and mutant strains. For that, protein samples were digested with trypsin and the resulting peptides were analyzed by LC-MS/MS (Q-Tof Premier, Waters). The spectra were acquired using software MassLynx v.4.1 and the raw data files were converted to a peak list format (mgf) by the software Mascot Distiller v.2.3.2.0, 2009 (Matrix Science Ldt.) and searched against the yeast database (NCBI- 6702 sequences; 3018299 residues; release data April, 2013) using Mascot engine v.2.3.01 (Matrix Science Ltd.), with carbamidomethylation as fixed modifications, oxidation of methionine as variable modification, one trypsin missed cleavage and a tolerance of 0.1 Da for both precursor and fragment ions. Peptides were considered as unique when it differed in at least 1 amino acid residue. Among these, covalently modified peptides, including N- or C-terminal elongation (i.e. missed cleavages) were counted as unique, but different charge states of the same peptide and modifications were not considered as a criterion to differentiate peptides. Unique peptides with a minimum of five amino acid residues and displaying a significant threshold (p<0.05) in Mascot-based score were considered. The results showed that lower amounts of the exosome subunits are co-purified with the mutant Rrp43p proteins. Additionally, by decreasing the stability of the exosome, other non-specific protein interactions are favored. Therefore, data reported here indicate that complexes containing a mutant Rrp43p exhibit decreased stability and provide information on additional protein interactions.","publicationDate":"2014-04-15","submissionType":"COMPLETE","numAssays":12,"species":["Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker's yeast)"],"tissues":[],"ptmNames":["iodoacetamide derivatized residue","monohydroxylated residue"],"instrumentNames":["Q-Tof Premier","instrument model"],"projectTags":[],"doi":"10.6019/PXD000580","submitter":{"title":"Dr","firstName":"Rogerio","lastName":"LourenÃ§o","email":"lourenco@iq.usp.br","affiliation":"Biochemistry"},"labHeads":[],"submissionDate":"2013-11-14","reanalysis":null,"experimentTypes":["Bottom-up proteomics"],"quantificationMethods":[],"keywords":"Saccharomyces cerevisiae, LC-MS/MS","sampleProcessingProtocol":"Not available","dataProcessingProtocol":"Not available","otherOmicsLink":null,"numProteins":650,"numPeptides":4567,"numSpectra":10787,"numUniquePeptides":2202,"numIdentifiedSpectra":3994,"references":[{"desc":"Lourenço RF, Leme AF, Oliveira CC.

After equilibrating the column each sample was loaded via a Famos autosampler (LC Packings, San Francisco CA) onto the column.

(ThermoFisher, San Jose, CA). Enzyme specificity was set to partially tryptic with 2 missed cleavages. Modifications included carboxyamidomethyl (cysteines, fixed) and oxidation (methionine, variable). Mass tolerance was set to 2.0 for precursor ions and 1.0 for fragment ions. The database searched was the Human IPI databases version 3.6. The number of entries in the database was 160,900 which included both the target (forward) and the decoy (reversed) human sequences. Spectral matches were filtered to contain less than 1% FDR at the peptide level based on the target-decoy method. Finally, only tryptic matches were reported and spectral matches were manually examined. When peptides matched to multiple proteins, the peptide was assigned so that only the most logical protein was included (Occam's razor). This same principle was used for isoforms when present in the database.        Regarding the PRIDE XML result files: there are some delta m/z values that exceeded the normal limits. That is because all the Cysteins (C) in our experiments are modified by iodoacetamide (MOD:01214). The mass difference is 57 (total mass is 160, pride converter recognized it as 160). In addition to that, some Cysteins are dynamically modified to S-carboxamidoethyl-L-cysteine (MOD: 00417). We used C# and the mass difference is 14 in comparing with iodoacetamide cystein (total 174, 71 in comparing with unmodified cystein, pride converter recognized it as 71). The search was set up to be able to find alkylated cysteine if the cysteines were treated with iodoacetamide or if they were not to find the presence of mono-acrylamide adducts on cysteine. These numbers are different to the default mass diff in PRIDE converter and thus caused the identifications with big delta m/z. I have checked the peptides with big delta m/z and they are all correct identifications and match with our final identification list in our manuscript. So I am sure we have used the correct PTM MODs for our experiments.","otherOmicsLink":null,"numProteins":690407,"numPeptides":1125431,"numSpectra":1125582,"numUniquePeptides":1017531,"numIdentifiedSpectra":1125431,"references":[{"desc":"Xu S, Li X, Gong Z, Wang W, Li Y, Nair BC, Piao H, Yang K, Wu G, Chen J.

{"accession":"PXD000594","title":"An investigation into the protein composition of the Glossina morsitans morsitans peritrophic matrix","projectDescription":"Background: Tsetse flies serve as biological vectors for several species of African trypanosomes. In order to survive, proliferate and establish a midgut infection, trypanosomes must cross the tsetse fly peritrophic matrix (PM), an acellular gut lining surrounding the blood meal. Crossing of this multi layered structure occurs at least twice during parasite migration and development, but the mechanism of how they do so is poorly understood. In order to better comprehend the molecular events surrounding trypanosome crossing of the tsetse PM, a mass spectrometry-based approach was applied to investigate the PM protein composition using Glossina morsitans morsitans as a model organism. Methods: Urea-SDS extracts of tsetse PM proteins were either subject to an in solution tryptic digestion or fractionated on 1D SDS-PAGE and the resulting bands digested with trypsin. The tryptic fragments from both preparations were purified and analysed by 2D-LC-MS/MS. Tandem MS data were searched against the Glossina-morsitans-Yale_PEPTIDES_GmorY1.1 database downloaded from VectorBase (https://www.vectorbase.org/proteomes) using the Mascot (version 2.3.02, Matrix Science) search engine. Search parameters were a precursor mass tolerance of 10 ppm for the in-solution digest using the LTQ-Orbitrap Velos and 0.6 Da for the lower resolution LTQ instrument. Fragment mass tolerance was 0.6 Da for both instruments. One missed cleavage was permitted, carbamidomethylation was set as a fixed modification and oxidation (M) was included as a variable modification. For in-solution data, the false discovery rate was <1%, and individual ion scores >30 were considered to indicate identity or extensive homology (p <0.05 ).        Results: Overall, over 200 proteins were identified, several of those containing Chitin Binding Domains (CBD), a signature of insect PM proteins, including novel peritrophins and peritrophin-like glycoproteins, which are essential in maintaining PM architecture and may act as trypanosome adhesins. Furthermore, a minimum of 27 proteins were also identified from the tsetse secondary endosymbiont, Sodalis glossinidius, suggesting this bacterium is probably in close association with the tsetse PM. Conclusion: To our knowledge this is the first report on the protein composition of G. m. morsitans, an important vector of African trypanosomes. Further functional analyses of these proteins will lead to a better understanding of the tsetse physiology as well as to identification of potential targets to block trypanosome development within the tsetse.","publicationDate":"2014-07-22","submissionType":"COMPLETE","numAssays":30,"species":["Glossina morsitans"],"tissues":["peritrophic membrane"],"ptmNames":["iodoacetamide derivatized residue","monohydroxylated residue"],"instrumentNames":["instrument model","LTQ"],"projectTags":["Biological"],"doi":"10.6019/PXD000594","submitter":{"title":"Dr","firstName":"Stuart","lastName":"Armstrong","email":"sarmstro@liv.ac.uk","affiliation":"Infection Biology"},"labHeads":[],"submissionDate":"2013-11-26","reanalysis":null,"experimentTypes":["Bottom-up proteomics"],"quantificationMethods":[],"keywords":"Glossina morsitans morsitans, peritrophic matrix, LC-MS/MS","sampleProcessingProtocol":"Not available","dataProcessingProtocol":"Not available","otherOmicsLink":null,"numProteins":400,"numPeptides":1053,"numSpectra":39780,"numUniquePeptides":545,"numIdentifiedSpectra":907,"references":[{"desc":"Rose C, Belmonte R, Armstrong SD, Molyneux G, Haines LR, Lehane MJ, Wastling J, Acosta-Serrano A.

{"accession":"PXD000623","title":"Quantification of ErbB network proteins in three cell types using complementary approaches identifies cell general and cell type-specific signaling proteins","projectDescription":"Relating protein concentration to cell-type-specific responses is one of the remaining challenges for obtaining a quantitative systems level understanding of mammalian signaling. Here we used mass-spectrometry (MS)- and antibody-based quantitative proteomic approaches to measure protein abundances for 75% of a hand-curated reconstructed ErbB network of 198 proteins, in two established cell types (HEK293 and MCF-7) and in primary keratinocyte cells. Comparison with other quantitative studies allowed building a set of ErbB network proteins expressed in all cells and another which are cell-specific and could impart specific properties to the network. As a proof-of-concept of the importance of protein concentration, we generated a small simplified mathematical model encompassing ligand binding, followed by receptor dimerization, activation, and degradation. The model predicts ErbB phosphorylation in HEK293, MCF-7, and keratinocyte cells simply by incorporating cell-type-specific ErbB1, ErbB2, and caveolin-1 abundances but otherwise contains similar rate constants. Altogether, the data provide a resource for protein abundances and localization to be included in larger mathematical models, enabling the generation of cell-type-specific computational models. Shotgun MS/MS analysis was conducted on HEK293 cells and on primary keratinocytes and SRM was used for all 3 cell types. Acquired data were analyzed using the Proteome Discoverer software suite (v1.3.0.339, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and the Mascot search engine (v2.3, Matrix Science) was used for peptide identification. Data were searched against an in-house generated database containing all proteins corresponding to human in the Swissprot human database (as of 3/2013) with 600 added common contaminants, as previously described, with a total number of 37 694 sequences in the database. A precursor ion mass tolerance of 7 ppm at the MS1 level was used, and up to three miscleavages for trypsin were allowed. The fragment ion mass tolerance was set to 0.5 Da. Oxidation of methionine and protein acetylation at the N-terminal was defined as variable modification. Carbamidomethylation on cysteines was set as a fix modification.

Platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) is a mitogen and motogen that has been implicated in the proliferation, migration and synthetic activities of smooth muscle cells (SMC) that characterize pathologic tissue remodeling in hollow organs.  To explore the signals induced by PDGF on a global scale, we performed expression profiling and quantitative proteomics analysis of PDGF-treated human visceral SMC. 1695 genes and 241 proteins were identified as differentially expressed in PDGF-treated primary bladder SMC versus non-treated cells. Analysis of gene expression data revealed MYC, JUN, EGR1, MYB and RUNX1 as the transcription factors most significantly networked with upregulated genes; DDIT3, NFAT5, and SOX5 were most networked with downregulated genes.        For protein identification and quantification, raw mass spectrometric data were analyzed with MaxQuant software (version 1.0.13.13). The parameters were set as follows. In the Quant module, SILAC triplets was selected; oxidation (M) and acetyl (Protein N-term) were set as variable modification; carbamidomethyl (C) was set as fixed modification; concatenated IPI human database (version 3.52) (74,190 forward sequences and 74,190 reverse sequences) was used for database searching; all other parameters were default.

Bacillus methanolicus MGA3 is a facultative methylotroph of industrial relevance that is able to grow on methanol as its sole source of carbon and energy. The Gram-positive bacterium possesses a soluble NAD-dependent methanol dehydrogenase and assimilates formaldehyde via the ribulose monophosphate (RuMP) cycle. We used label-free quantitative proteomics to generate reference proteome data for this bacterium and compared the proteome of B. methanolicus MGA3 on two different carbon sources (methanol and mannitol) as well as two different growth temperatures (50°C and 37°C). From a total of approximately 1,200 different detected proteins, approximately 1,000 of these were used for quantification. While the levels of 213 proteins were significantly different at the two growth temperatures tested, the levels of 109 proteins changed significantly when cells were grown on different carbon sources. The carbon source strongly affected the expression of enzymes related to carbon metabolism, and in particular, both dissimilatory and assimilatory RuMP cycle enzyme levels were elevated during growth on methanol compared to mannitol.

A cell pellet corresponding to 2.5 x 106 cells was lysed with 1% SDS, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, on ice, followed by incubation Benzonase (purity > 99 %) and 2 mM MgCl2 for 30 min at 37°C. Protein concentration was determined using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Thermo Scientific) followed by reduction of disulfide bonds with 10 mM DTT for 30 min at 56°C and carbamidomethylation of free sulfhydryl groups with 20 mM IAA for 30 min at room temperature, in the dark.  The sample was diluted 10-fold with cold ethanol (-40°C) and stored at -40°C for 1 h, followed by centrifugation at 25,000 x g and 4°C for 30 min.

{"accession":"PXD000682","title":"Transcriptomic and Proteomic Response of HC-04 to hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)","projectDescription":"The routine study of human malaria liver-stage biology in vitro is hampered by low infection efficiency of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) lines (<0.1%), poor understanding of steady-state HCC biology, and lack of appropriate tools for trace sample analysis. HC-04 is the only HCC that supports complete development of human malaria parasites. We hypothesized that HCCs are in various intermediate stages of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and HC-04s retain epithelial characteristics that permit infection. We developed an novel analytical approach to test this hypothesis viz. the HC-04 response to hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). We used online two-dimensional liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (2D-LC-MS/MS) to quantify protein expression profiles in HC-04 pre-/post-HGF treatment and validated these results by RT-qPCR and microscopy. We successfully increased protein identification efficiency over offline-2D methods by 12-fold using less sample material, allowing robust protein quantification. We observed expected up-regulation and down-regulation of EMT protein markers in response to HGF, but also unexpected cellular responses. HC-04 is thus susceptible to HGF-mediated signaling but to a lesser degree than what we observed for HepG2, a widely used, but poor malaria HCC model.  Our analytical approach to understanding the basic biology of HC-04 helps us understand the factors that may influence its utility as a model for malaria liver-stage development. We observed that HC-04 treatment with HGF prior to the addition of Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites did not facilitate cell invasion, arguing for unlinking the effect of HGF on malaria liver stage development from hepatocyte invasion. Finally, our 2D-LC-MS/MS approach and broadly applicable experimental strategy should prove useful in the analysis of various hepatocyte-pathogen interactions, tumor progression and early disease events.","publicationDate":"2014-02-17","submissionType":"COMPLETE","numAssays":51,"species":["Homo sapiens (Human)"],"tissues":[],"ptmNames":["Carbamidomethyl","Oxidation"],"instrumentNames":["6520 Quadrupole Time-of-Flight LC/MS"],"projectTags":["Highlighted","Biomedical"],"doi":"10.6019PXD000682","submitter":{"title":"Dr","firstName":"Dingyin","lastName":"Tao","email":"dtao@jhsph.edu","affiliation":"W.

We performed soluble protein digestion using RapiGest SF as described , and the membrane protein fraction was digested according to a Filter-Aided Sample Preparation (FASP) protocol using a 10 kDa molecular weight cutoff filter (EMD Millipore, Billerica, Massachusetts).  To construct the online 2D methods, we integrated one SCX column (150 μm i.d. * 2 cm length, PolySULFOETHYL ATM, 5 μm 300 A, PolyLC INC) into an Agilent LC-MS system comprised of a 1200 LC system coupled to a 6520 QTOF via an HPLC Chip Cube interface. For the online SCX fractionation, in the first dimension peptides were loaded into the SCX column at 1.8 μL/min and the peptides were eluted using the autosampler by injecting 6 μL of each increasing salt concentration (0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 120, 160 and 300 mM NaCl in 2% ACN/0.1% FA; followed by one injection of 500 mM NaCl in 2% ACN/0.1% FA to wash the column).

In the second dimension, with valve switched and RPLC gradient started, the peptides were eluted from the enrichment column and separated by a C18 analytical column. Elution of peptides from the analytical column was performed using a stepped gradient starting at 97% A (A: 99.9% water, 0.1% FA) at 300 nL/min.

Peptides were searched using fully tryptic cleavage constraints and up to two internal cleavages sites were allowed for tryptic digestion. Fixed modifications consisted of carbamidomethylation of cysteine. Variable modifications considered were oxidation of methionine residues. The Mascot searched results were exported as .DAT format and then imported into Scaffold software (Version 4.0.4, Proteome Software) for curation, label0-free quantification analysis, and visualization. Scaffold’s normalized  spectral counting was employed to compare relative protein abundance between naïve HC-04 and HGF treated HC-04 cell samples in each experiment as the basis for normalization of the spectral counts for all other LC-MS/MS data in that experiment. Scaffold calculates the spectrum count quantitative value by normalizing spectral counts across an experiment. The process of calculating normalized spectral counts is as follows: First, Scaffold takes the sum of all the Total Spectrum Counts for each MS sample. The sums are then scaled to the same level. Scaffold then applies the scaling factor for each sample to each protein group to produce an output with a normalized quantitative value.","otherOmicsLink":null,"numProteins":216128,"numPeptides":806210,"numSpectra":679909,"numUniquePeptides":336580,"numIdentifiedSpectra":679848,"references":[{"desc":"Tao D, King JG, Tweedell RE, Jost PJ, Boddey JA, Dinglasan RR.

{"accession":"PXD000688","title":"Human milk and gastric peptidomics","projectDescription":"It is unclear to what degree protein degradation occurs in the infant stomach and whether peptides previously annotated for bioactivity are released. This study combined nanospray liquid chromatography separation with time of flight mass spectrometry, comprehensive structural libraries and informatics to interrogate milk of three human mothers and the gastric aspirates from their 4–12 day post-partum infants. Milk from the mothers contained almost two hundred distinct peptides, demonstrating enzymatic degradation of milk proteins beginning either during lactation or between milk collection and feeding. In the gastric samples, 649 milk peptides were identified, demonstrating that digestion continues in the infant stomach. The majority of peptides in both the intact milk and gastric samples were derived from β-casein. The numbers of peptides from β-casein, lactoferrin, α-lactalbumin, lactadherin, κ-casein, serum albumin, bile-salt associated lipase and xanthine dehydrogenase/oxidase were significantly higher in the gastric samples than the milk samples (p<0.05). Six hundred three peptides were significantly different in abundance between milk and gastric samples (p<0.05). Most of the identified peptides have previously identified biological activity. Gastric proteolysis occurs in the term infant in the first two weeks of life releasing biologically active milk peptides with immunomodulatory, antibacterial, and calcium-binding activity of clinical relevance to the proximal intestinal tract.","publicationDate":"2014-04-15","submissionType":"COMPLETE","numAssays":40,"species":["Homo sapiens (Human)"],"tissues":[],"ptmNames":["phosphorylated residue","deaminated residue","dehydrated residue","monohydroxylated residue","deamidated residue","acetylated residue"],"instrumentNames":["6520 Quadrupole Time-of-Flight LC/MS"],"projectTags":[],"doi":"10.6019PXD000688","submitter":{"title":"Dr","firstName":"David","lastName":"Dallas","email":"dcdallas@ucdavis.edu","affiliation":"University of California, Davis"},"labHeads":[{"title":"Dr","firstName":"David","lastName":"Dallas","email":"dcdallas@ucdavis.edu","affiliation":"UC Davis"}],"submissionDate":"2014-02-04","reanalysis":null,"experimentTypes":["Shotgun proteomics"],"quantificationMethods":[],"keywords":"human milk, peptidomics","sampleProcessingProtocol":"Materials. Acetonitrile (ACN)9, formic acid (FA) and trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) were obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA) and trichloroacetic acid (TCA) from EMD Millipore (Darmstadt, Germany). All water used was nanopure (18.2 Ohm).  Subjects and samples. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of California Davis.  Following informed consent, intact milk samples were obtained from three healthy mothers who delivered at term (see Table 1 for infant metadata). The breast was cleansed with water on a wash cloth (no soap or alcohol) and then the milk samples were collected by an electric pump into a sterile plastic container.  Samples from both breasts were combined and then frozen in a home freezer and transported on ice to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at UC Davis Children’s Hospital and kept frozen at -20°C. Time of day of pumping was not specified or recorded. The three term infants were hospitalized due to health problems unrelated to the gastrointestinal tract (Table 1). Two of the infants received intravenous antibiotics prior to sample collection which may alter the gastric microbiota.  None of the babies received oral antibiotics or acid-suppressing agents. The infants’ conditions precluded normal feeding, therefore, a naso-gastric tube was placed for each. The milk samples were thawed in warm (not hot) water and stored in a refrigerator at 4°C until feeding. Just prior to feeding, an aliquot of milk was re-frozen at -40°C. The unfortified milk was fed via the naso-gastric tube over 30 minutes. Two hours after the initiation of the feeding, a fraction of the gastric contents was collected back through the tube via suction for each infant and stored at –40°C. Milk and gastric acid samples were transported to the UC Davis laboratory on dry ice and stored at –80°C until analysis.  Sample preparation. Samples were removed from the freezer and thawed on ice. Then, they were vortexed for 1 min each. Peptides were extracted, with the following modifications. A 100 μL sample of mother’s expressed breast milk and 100 μL of infant’s gastric fluid were used. To each sample, 100 μL of nanopure water were added, and the samples were again vortexed. The samples were then incubated at 100°C to prevent any further enzyme-driven proteolysis. Briefly, samples were delipidated by centrifugation and proteins in the infranate samples were precipitated with 1:1 (sample to solution) 200 g/L TCA, followed by plate vortexing, centrifugation and removal of the supernatant. Supernatants were applied to 96-well C18 solid-phase extraction plate to purify peptides. Eluted peptides were dried by vacuum centrifugation and rehydrated in 60 μL nanopure water for quadrupole time-of-flight (Q-TOF) analysis. Two microliters of 0.1 μg/μL peptide standards containing equal parts Leu-enkephalin, gonadoliberin, angiotensin I and neurotensin (ProteoChem, Loves Park, IL, USA) were added to map retention time reproducibility of the samples.","dataProcessingProtocol":"Peptide analysis. The analysis was performed with the Agilent nano-liquid chromatography chip-cube 6520 quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometer (Santa Clara, CA, USA). The chip employed contained an enrichment and analytical column packed with a C18 stationary phase. . Briefly, the gradient elution solvents were (A) 3% ACN/0.1% FA and (B) 90% ACN/0.1% FA. The gradient employed was ramped from 0–8% B from 0–5 min, 8–26.5% B from 5–24 min, 26.5–100% B from 24–48 min, followed by 100% B for 2 min and 100% A for 10 min (to re-equilibrate the column). Each sample was run in triplicate on the Q-TOF in MS-only mode.  Creation of peptide library. To create a peptide library, these gastric and intact samples for term-delivered infants were run using the same method. Data were exported to Mascot Generic Format (.mgf) and analyzed via the downloadable version of X!Tandem (thegpm.org) against a library of human milk proteins derived from previous human milk proteomes. Briefly, no complete modifications were required, but possible phosphorylations of serine, threonine or tyrosine, deamidation of glutamine or asparagine, and oxidation of methionine or tryptophan were allowed. Error tolerances employed were 20 ppm for precursor masses and 40 ppm for fragment masses.  The results from X!Tandem for all samples were compiled for milk samples and for gastric samples, separately. Peptides with e-values ≤ 0.01 were removed (a 99% confidence level threshold). To isolate only unique peptide sequences, all duplicates of sequence, protein and modifications combined were eliminated with the “remove duplicates” function in Excel. Peptides representing identical amino acid sequences and modifications but modified in different positions were also removed as duplicates. The compiled peptide libraries were then used to make an exclusion list for recursive analysis. Recursive analysis was repeated until the number of new peptides returned for each sample was ≤10. Three rounds of recursive analysis were completed for the milk samples (for a total of four MS/MS runs for each). Five rounds were completed for two of the gastric samples (for a total of six MS/MS runs for each). One gastric sample with retention times repeatedly different than the other two gastric samples was examined alone—and required ten rounds of recursive analysis before the number of new peptides returned was ≤10. Peptides were identified via the above procedure and the results from the recursive analysis were added to the original peptide results. Peptide identification. Compounds were identified from all samples by the “Batch Targeted Feature Extraction” function in Agilent MassHunter Profinder B.06.00. The data were searched against the peptide library based on the molecular formula. One library generated from milk peptide library was used to extract milk sample peptide peak areas and two different libraries were used to extract the gastric peptides (as one sample had consistently different retention times). The milk peptide library could not be applied to the gastric samples because they showed retention time shifts in comparison with the milk peptides, likely due to molecular interactions within the sample matrices. For library searching, the following parameters were employed. The maximum number of matches per formula was 1. Peaks were matched on both mass (within 20 ppm error) and retention time (within 1 min error). A height threshold of 500 ion counts was employed. The charge carrier was protons, and the allowed charge states were 1-7.  The isotope model was “peptides.” Extracted ion chromatogram peaks were smoothed with the Gaussian function and the resulting peaks were integrated via the “agile” algorithm. After compounds were extracted, each peak was manually inspected for peak integration and any incorrect assignments were corrected within the Profinder program.","otherOmicsLink":null,"numProteins":371,"numPeptides":3538,"numSpectra":34597,"numUniquePeptides":1998,"numIdentifiedSpectra":3092,"references":[{"desc":"Dallas DC, Guerrero A, Khaldi N, Borghese R, Bhandari A, Underwood MA, Lebrilla CB, German JB, Barile D.

Giardia trophozoites reside in the host intestines where they largely depend on scavenging metabolites from the surrounding through endocytosis and/or pinocytosis. A canonical endo‐lysosomal system however is inexistent, but small peripheral vesicles (PVs) have been described which have partial endocytic characteristics but lack endocytic hallmarks: (i) unlike the dynamic multivesicular endo-lysosomal system in mammalian cells, PVs have a fixed location at the cell periphery and show no lateral cargo exchange; (ii) PVs lack maturation-specific markers. For transmission to a new host, motile trophozoites differentiate to cysts and thus secrete a protective cyst wall (CW). Giardia however has no Golgi or to organize regulated secretion of CW material. Instead, differentiating cells generate specialized organelles termed encystation‐specific vesicles (ESVs), being stage-regulated Golgi relic organelles dedicated to post‐translational maturation of the CW material. Basic sorting processes in maturing ESVs have been identified recently, but underlying mechanisms remain unknown.  To define the first proteome of ESVs and PVs, we used a new strategy combining flow cytometry-based organelle sorting with in silico filtration of mass spectrometry data.","publicationDate":"2014-03-11","submissionType":"COMPLETE","numAssays":126,"species":["Giardia intestinalis (strain ATCC 50803 / WB clone C6) (Giardia lamblia)"],"tissues":[],"ptmNames":["iodoacetamide derivatized residue","monohydroxylated residue"],"instrumentNames":["LTQ Orbitrap"],"projectTags":["Biomedical","Biological"],"doi":"10.6019PXD000694","submitter":{"title":"","firstName":"Adrian","lastName":"Hehl","email":"adrian.hehl@access.uzh.ch","affiliation":"Institute of Parasitology"},"labHeads":[{"title":"Dr","firstName":"Adrian B.","lastName":"Hehl","email":"adrian.hehl@access.uzh.ch","affiliation":"Institute of Parasitology, University of Zurich, Switzerland"}],"submissionDate":"2014-01-21","reanalysis":null,"experimentTypes":["Shotgun proteomics"],"quantificationMethods":["Spectrum counting"],"keywords":"Giardia, encystation, endocytosis, flow cytometry assisted organelle sorting, organelle proteomics","sampleProcessingProtocol":"Organelle staining (PV organelles: endocytic uptake of a fluid phase marker, ESV organelles; GFP-fusion protein), cell disruption by mild sonication, organelle enrichment by flow cytometry, PRMM protein precipitation, 1D-SDS-PAGE, in-gel digestion with trypsin, sample analysis on a LTQ Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer coupled to an Eksigent-Nano-HPLC system.","dataProcessingProtocol":"The raw-files from the mass spectrometer were converted into Mascot generic files (mgf) with Mascot Distiller software 2.4.2.0 (Matrix Science Ltd., London, UK).

Immunoglobulin light-chain amyloidosis the most common form of amyloidosis can appear as a local disorder presented with mild symptoms or as a life threatening systemic disease. Identification of the proteins forming amyloid fibrils is essential for the diagnosis of the disease and knowledge about the overall protein composition of the deposits may lead to a larger understanding of the deposition events thereby facilitating a more detailed picture of the molecular pathology.  In this study, we investigated the protein composition of AL amyloid deposits isolated from human eyelid, conjunctival and orbital specimens.

Proteins in the captured amyloid and control samples were identified by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry and subsequently quantified using the label-free mass spectrometry quantification method exponential modified Protein Abundance Index.   Immunoglobulin light chain kappa or lambda was revealed to be the most predominant protein in the amyloid deposits. In addition, the protein profiles identified apolipoprotein E and serum amyloid P component to be associated with the immunoglobulin light chain deposits across all three tissues analyzed.

Tissue was collected on CapSure Macro LCM Caps (Applied Biosystem), subsequently placed in sterile 0.5 ml Eppendorf Biopur Microcentrifuge Tubes (VWR) and stored at -80°C until further processed. Proteins from the laser capture microdissected eyelid, conjunctival and orbital tissue samples were extracted using a modified protocol of the Liquid Tissue MS Protein Prep Kit (Expression Pathology Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). LCM films containing captured plaque and control tissue samples were stripped from the caps and incubated with 40 µl extraction buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.8, 0.1 % RapiGest (Waters)) at 95 ˚C for 90 min. Samples were centrifuged at 10.000 × g for 1 min and subsequently cooled on ice. Extracted proteins were incubated with 5 µg porcine trypsin (Sigma) at 37 ˚C for 16 hours, vortexing every 20 min for the first hour. Samples were then centrifuged at 10.000 × g for 5 min, supernatant isolated and incubated with 10 mM DTT at 95 ˚C for 5 min followed by incubation with 30 mM iodoacetamide for 15 min in the dark. Peptides generated from each digest were acidified with 5 µl of 5% formic acid and recovered using Stage-tips (Proxeon, Thermo Scientific). The peptides were eluted with 10 µl 70 % acetonitrile, and subsequently lyophilized before dissolved in 12 µl 0.1 % formic acid. The samples were subsequently analyzed by LC-MS/MS using nanoflow liquid chromatography on an Easy-nLC system (Thermo Scientific) coupled directly to a TripleTOF 5600 mass spectrometer (AB Sciex). Samples were loaded on a 0.1x21 mm C18 trap column and a 0.075x150 mm C18 analytical column (NanoSeparations). Peptides were eluted and directly electrosprayed into the mass spectrometer using a 60 min gradient from 5-40% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 250 nl/min. Data was acquired using an ion spray voltage of 2.6 kV, curtain gas of 30, and an interface heater temperature of 150 °C. For IDA, survey scans were acquired in 250 ms, and as many as 50 product ion scans were collected if exceeding a threshold of 125 counts per second (counts/s) and with a +2 to +5 charge-state. A sweeping collision energy setting of 40 ± 15 eV was applied to all precursor ions for collision-induced dissociation. Dynamic exclusion was set for ½ of peak width (~6 s), and then the precursor was refreshed off of the exclusion list.","dataProcessingProtocol":"The mass spectrometry data was processed and Swiss-Prot database was queried using an in-house Mascot search engine (Matrix Science, London, England version 2.2.06) with a peptide tolerance of +/- 10 ppm, MS/MS tolerance of 0.2 Da, carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues as a fixed modification, methionine oxidation and proline hydroxylation as variable modifications, semiTrypsin as enzyme, 1 missed cleavage was allowed and ESI-QUAD-TOF mass spectrometer was selected as instrument. The Mascot search results were imported to the MS Data Miner (MDM) software with an ions score cut-off value of 45. MS/MS spectra validation of protein identifications based on less than 2 unique peptides with ion scores less than 100 were validated automatically in MDM and manually. Only MS/MS spectra containing a consecutive b or y-ion series of at least 3 fragments were accepted in MDM. The remaining MS/MS spectra of protein identifications were manually validated as only spectra containing a clear sequence tag of at least three consecutive residues with high intensity compared to the background were accepted. The data was then exported to excel and contaminating exogenous proteins were removed. Among these human tryptic peptides identical to porcine tryptic peptides were considered as contaminants as porcine trypsin was used for sample processing. The resulting endogenous proteins were listed according to their emPAI values, which reflect their relative abundance. The molar fractions of the endogenous proteins were calculated by dividing the emPAI value for each identified protein with the total emPAI value.","otherOmicsLink":null,"numProteins":8624,"numPeptides":55854,"numSpectra":218256,"numUniquePeptides":15977,"numIdentifiedSpectra":33985,"references":[]}

The morphological changes observed in Fuchs’ endothelial corneal dystrophy is well described, however, much less in known of the pathology at the molecular level. As the morphological changes observed in the cornea is profound in the extracellular matrix we sought to determine in protein profiles and changes herein in the Descement’s membrane and endothelium layer of Fuchs’ endothelial conrneal dystrophy patients when compared to healthy control tissue. Using the extracted ion chromatogram label-free MS based quantification method we quantified approximately the 50 most abundant proteins of the Descemet’s membrane and endothelial layer in in patient and control tissue. In addition, using the isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification MS method resulted in a total of 22 regulated proteins of which the majority were extracellular proteins known to be involved in proper assembly and modulation of the basement membrane in other tissues. Many of the regulated proteins were furthermore among the most abundant proteins quantified. The two MS methods performed here suggest altered arrangement of the extracellular matrix in Fuchs’ endothelial corneal dystrophy and provide new candidate proteins that may be involved in molecular mechanism of this disease.","publicationDate":"2014-05-27","submissionType":"COMPLETE","numAssays":61,"species":["Homo sapiens (Human)"],"tissues":["cornea"],"ptmNames":["2","iodoacetamide derivatized residue","iTRAQ4plex-116 reporter+balance reagent acylated residue","monohydroxylated residue"],"instrumentNames":["TripleTOF 5600"],"projectTags":["Biomedical"],"doi":"10.6019PXD000746","submitter":{"title":"Dr","firstName":"Ebbe Toftgaard","lastName":"Poulsen","email":"etp@mb.au.dk","affiliation":"Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics"},"labHeads":[{"title":"Dr","firstName":"Jan Johannes","lastName":"Enghild","email":"jje@mb.au.dk","affiliation":"Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Aarhus University, Denmark"}],"submissionDate":"2014-02-07","reanalysis":null,"experimentTypes":["Shotgun proteomics"],"quantificationMethods":["iTRAQ","TIC"],"keywords":"Fuchs' endothelial corneal dystrophy, XIC quantification, iTRAQ quantification","sampleProcessingProtocol":"Sample preparation for LC-MS/MS – in-solution digest – Patient and control tissues were lyophilized for 10 h using a speedvac concentrator before subjection to 0.66 M CNBr in 70% trifluoroacetic acid overnight at 23°C.

The samples were then diluted 5 times with 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, and digested overnight with 1:50 w/w sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) at 37°C for 16 h in a final volume of 0.5 mL. The samples were desalted using POROS 50 R2 RP column material (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) packed in GELoader Tips (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany).  iTRAQ labeling and strong cation-exchange fractionation – Isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) analysis was performed using 10 µg of in-solution digested sample from each patient and control. Samples were labeled with iTRAQ 4plex (AB SCIEX, Framingham, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol for 1 hour and mixed according to figure 1, resulting in a total of five sets of 4plex experiments. A mixed sample containing 5 µg sample from each of the patients and controls was labeled with the iTRAQ 114-tag in all five experiments and used to normalize between experiments. Each 4plex experiment was diluted 10 times in buffer A (0.5% formic acid and 5% acetonitrile) and separated by strong cation exchange (SCX) using a PL-SCX 1000 Å 5 μm 20 × 2.1 mm column (Higgins Analytical, Rengstorff, CA, USA) equilibrated in buffer A and connected to an Ettan LC system (GE Healthcare, Wauwatosa, WI, USA) at a flow rate of 100 μL/min. The peptides were eluted using a 1% B/min linear gradient from buffer A to buffer B (0.5% formic acid, 5% acetonitrile containing 1 M NaCl) into 15 fractions. The samples were lyophilized and desalted using POROS 50 R2 material packed in GELoader tips. The desalted samples were lyophilized and resuspended in 12 μL 0.1% formic acid and stored at −20 °C.

The CNBr and trypsin cleaved samples were dissolved in 0.1% formic acid, injected and trapped on a Biosphere C18 column (5 μm, 2 cm x 100 μm I.D; Nano Separations, Nieuwkoop, Netherlands). Next, the peptides were eluted from the trap column and separated on a 15 cm analytical column (75 μm i.d.) packed in-house in a fritted silica tip (New Objectives, Woburn, MA, USA) with RP ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ 3 μm resin (Dr. Marisch GmbH, Ammerbuch-Entringen, Germany) connected in-line to the mass spectrometer.

The MS files were converted to Mascot generic format (MGF) using the AB SCIEX MS Data Converter beta 1.3 (AB SCIEX) and the \"proteinpilot MGF\" parameters. The peak lists were used to interrogate the Swiss-Prot (v. 2013_11, 541,762 sequences) Homo sapiens (20,279 sequences) database using Mascot 2.3.02. Trypsin was employed as enzyme allowing one missed cleavage. Carbamidomethyl was entered as a fixed modification, whereas oxidation of methionine and hydrozylation of proline were entered as variable modifications. The mass accuracy of the precursor and product ions were 10 ppm and 0.2 da, and the instrument setting was specified as ESI-QUAD-TOF. The significance threshold (p) was set at 0.01 and the ion score expect cut-off at 0.005. Mascot dat result files were used to generate a spectral library in Skyline using the human sequences from Swiss-Prot as background proteome. Employing the same parameters as for the Mascot search, the three most abundant peptides for each protein were manually chosen from all peptides available in the spectral library. Proteins identified with less than 3 peptides were not included in the XIC assay. In addition, only peptides quantified with an idotp value≥ 90 were included for XIC quantification. This label-free quantification protocol relies on the average MS signal response for the three most intense tryptic peptides for each protein. The relative abundance and standard deviation of proteins quantified in a minimum of three of the technical replicates was calculated as the average MS intensity for the three peptides for each protein divided by the sum of the average signal for all quantified proteins in the sample. A student’s t-test (p=0.05) was applied to test the XIC data for significant regulated proteins between the FECD and control group. The student’s t-test and average protein amounts shown in table 1 was only calculated on proteins quantified in a minimum of six patients in the FECD group and a minimum of three individuals in the control group.  iTRAQ quantification – The collected iTRAQ MS files were converted to Mascot generic format (MGF) using the AB SCIEX MS Data Converter beta 1.3 (AB SCIEX, Framingham, MA, USA) and the \"proteinpilot MGF\" parameters.

{"accession":"PXD000756","title":"Comparative analysis of the secretome from a model filarial nematode (Litomosoides sigmodontis) reveals maximal diversity in gravid female parasites","projectDescription":"Filarial nematodes (superfamily Filarioidea) are responsible for an annual global health burden of approximately 6.3 million disability-adjusted life-years, which represents the greatest single component of morbidity attributable to helminths affecting humans. No vaccine exists for the major filarial diseases, lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis; in part because research on protective immunity against filariae has been constrained because the human-parasitic species cannot complete their lifecycles in laboratory mice. However, the rodent filaria Litomosoides sigmodontis has become a popular experimental model, as BALB/c mice are fully permissive for its development and reproduction. Here, we provide a comprehensive analysis of excretory-secretory products from L. sigmodontis across five lifecycle stages. Applying intensity-based quantification, we determined the abundance of 302 unique excretory-secretory proteins, of which 64.6% were present in quantifiable amounts only from gravid adult female nematodes. This lifecycle stage, together with immature first-stage larvae (microfilariae), released four proteins that have not previously been evaluated as vaccine candidates: a predicted 28.5 kDa filaria-specific protein, a zonadhesin and SCO-spondin-like protein, a vitellogenin, and a protein containing six metridin-like ShK toxin domains. Female nematodes also released two proteins derived from the obligate Wolbachia symbiont. Notably, excretory-secretory products from all parasite stages contained several uncharacterised members of the transthyretin-like protein family. Furthermore, biotin labelling revealed that redox proteins and enzymes involved in purinergic signalling were enriched on the adult nematode cuticle. Comparison of the L. sigmodontis adult secretome with that of the human–infective filarial nematode Brugia malayi (reported previously in three independent published studies) identified differences that suggest a considerable underlying diversity of potential immunomodulators. The molecules identified in L. sigmodontis excretory-secretory products show promise not only for vaccination against filarial infections, but for the amelioration of allergy and autoimmune diseases.","publicationDate":"2014-07-22","submissionType":"COMPLETE","numAssays":77,"species":["Litomosoides sigmodontis (Filarial nematode worm)"],"tissues":["secretion","excretion","whole body"],"ptmNames":["iodoacetamide derivatized residue","monohydroxylated residue"],"instrumentNames":["LTQ Orbitrap"],"projectTags":["Biological"],"doi":"10.6019PXD000756","submitter":{"title":"Dr","firstName":"Stuart","lastName":"Armstrong","email":"sarmstro@liv.ac.uk","affiliation":"Infection Biology"},"labHeads":[{"title":"Dr","firstName":"Benjamin","lastName":"Makepeace","email":"blm1@liverpool.ac.uk","affiliation":"Department of Infection Biology Institute of Infection & Global Health University of Liverpool  Liverpool Science Park IC2 146 Brownlow Hill Liverpool L3 5RF UK"}],"submissionDate":"2014-02-13","reanalysis":null,"experimentTypes":["Shotgun proteomics"],"quantificationMethods":["MS1 intensity based label-free quantification method"],"keywords":"Filarial nematode, excretory-secretory products, LC-MS/MS, Litomosoides sigmodontis","sampleProcessingProtocol":"Sample preparation for proteomics StrataClean Resin containing bound ESP was washed twice with 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate before suspension in 0.1% RapiGest SF, 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate.

Several steps in the canonical Wnt/b-catenin signaling cascade are regulated by ubiquitylation, a protein modification that influences the stability, subcellular localization or protein-protein interactions of target proteins. To identify novel regulators of the Wnt/b-catenin pathway, we performed RNAi screens in C. elegans and human tissue culture cells and identified the HECT domain containing ubiquitin ligase eel-1/Huwe1 as a negative regulator of Wnt signaling. Huwe1 functions cell autonomously in signal-receiving cells and genetically acts upstream of b-catenin. Mechanistically, Huwe1 binds to and ubiquitylates the cytoplasmic Wnt pathway component Dishevelled (Dvl) in a Wnt3a and CK1e dependent manner. Huwe1 mediated ubiquitylation does not target Dvl for degradation. Instead, we found that Huwe1 decreases Dvl signaling by inhibiting Dvl multimerization. We conclude that Huwe1 is part of an evolutionarily conserved negative feedback loop in the Wnt/b-catenin pathway","publicationDate":"2014-05-28","submissionType":"COMPLETE","numAssays":7,"species":["Mus musculus (Mouse)"],"tissues":["cell culture"],"ptmNames":["ubiquitination signature dipeptidyl lysine","iodoacetamide derivatized residue","monohydroxylated residue"],"instrumentNames":["LTQ Orbitrap Elite"],"projectTags":["Biological"],"doi":"10.6019/PXD000781","submitter":{"title":"Mrs","firstName":"Katerina","lastName":"Sedova","email":"kaculen@seznam.cz","affiliation":"Masaryk University"},"labHeads":[{"title":"Dr","firstName":"Zbynek","lastName":"Zdrahal","email":"zdrahal@sci.muni.cz","affiliation":"Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic National Centre for Biomolecular research, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic"}],"submissionDate":"2014-05-27","reanalysis":null,"experimentTypes":["Affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry proteomics"],"quantificationMethods":[],"keywords":"ubiquitylation, Dvl, Wnt signaling","sampleProcessingProtocol":"Immunopurified proteins attached on beads or resolved by 1D PAGE were digested by trypsin in-solution or in-gel, respectively.

{"accession":"PXD000783","title":"The Phophoproteome of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii","projectDescription":"Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is the most intensively-studied and well-developed model for investigation of a wide-range of microalgal processes ranging from basic development through understanding triacylglycerol production. While proteomic technologies permit interrogation of these processes at the protein level and efforts to date indicate phosphorylation-based regulation of proteins in C. reinhardtii is essential for its underlying biology, characterization of the C. reinhardtii phosphoproteome has been limited. Herein, we report the richest exploration of the C. reinhardtii proteome to date. Complementary enrichment strategies were used to detect 4,588 phosphoproteins distributed among every cellular component in C. reinhardtii. Additionally, we report 18,160 unique phosphopeptides at <1% false discovery rate, which comprise 15,862 unique phosphosites – 98% of which are novel. Given that an estimated 30% of proteins in a eukaryotic cell are subject to phosphorylation, we report the majority of the phosphoproteome (23%) of C. reinhardtii. Proteins in key biological pathways were phosphorylated, including photosynthesis, pigment production, carbon assimilation, glycolysis, and protein and carbohydrate metabolism, and it is noteworthy that hyperphosphorylation was observed in flagellar proteins.  This rich dataset will significantly enhance understanding of a range of regulatory mechanisms controlling a variety of cellular process and will serve as a critical resource for the microalgal community.","publicationDate":"2014-06-10","submissionType":"COMPLETE","numAssays":6,"species":["Chlamydomonas reinhardtii CC3269"],"tissues":[],"ptmNames":["Carbamidomethyl","Phospho","Acetyl","Oxidation","Deamidated"],"instrumentNames":["LTQ Orbitrap Velos","TripleTOF 5600"],"projectTags":["Biological"],"doi":"10.6019/PXD000783","submitter":{"title":"Dr","firstName":"William","lastName":"Slade","email":"wslade@email.unc.edu","affiliation":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},"labHeads":[{"title":"Dr","firstName":"Leslie M.","lastName":"Hicks","email":"lmhicks@unc.edu","affiliation":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Dept. of Chemistry"}],"submissionDate":"2014-06-03","reanalysis":null,"experimentTypes":["Shotgun proteomics"],"quantificationMethods":[],"keywords":"algae, chlamydomonas, phosphoproteomics, phosphopeptides","sampleProcessingProtocol":"Protein digestion was performed as described previously with modifications (17). Samples were diluted 2-fold using 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate, reduced using 5 mM DTT for 45 min at room temperature, and alkylated using 10 mM iodoacetamide for 45 min at room temperature in the dark. The samples were then diluted to 1 M urea using 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate and modified trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) was added to a final enzyme:substrate w:w ratio of 1:30. At this step the protein concentration was 1-1.5 mg/mL. The trypsin digest was incubated at 37°C for 12 h. After digestion, the peptide mixture was frozen at -20°C to halt protease activity. Samples not immediately analyzed were stored at -80°C. Each biological replicate was split equally: 8 mg sample was used for TiO2-HILIC enrichment, and 8 mg for HILIC-PolyMAC enrichment. Three biological replicates, i.e. a total of 6 samples, were analyzed.  TiO2 beads (Titansphere TiO 5 m, GL Science, Inc. Japan) were equilibrated once using acetonitrile and once using loading buffer (80%ACN/5% TFA /saturated phthalic acid) for 5 min in each step. Solvent was removed at each step by a 2 min centrifugation at 20,000 x g. Trypsin-proteolyzed peptides were lyophilized in a vacuum centrifuge and resuspended in loading buffer to a final concentration of 1-1.5 mg/mL. The resultant solution was equilibrated with TiO2 beads in a w:w ratio of 1:5 and incubated for 1 h at room temperature using a head-to-head rotator at 30 rpm. The beads were washed once using 1.5 mL loading buffer and three times using 1.5 mL washing buffer (2% TFA/80% ACN), by incubating for 20 min. Phosphopeptides were eluted twice using 500 L 0.5% ammonium hydroxide  with shaking at 1400 rpm for 10 min; elutions were subsequently combined. Phosphopeptides were lyophilized in a vacuum centrifuge and stored at -80°C until further processing. PolyMAC (Tymora Analytical Operations, West Lafayette, IN) enrichment was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions with two modifications. The binding time was increased from 5 min to 1 h and the PolyMAC capture time was increased from 10 min to 30 min. PolyMAC (Tymora Analytical Operations, West Lafayette, IN) enrichment was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions with two modifications. The binding time was increased from 5 min to 1 h and the PolyMAC capture time was increased from 10 min to 30 min. The first replicate sample of each workflow was analyzed using an LTQ-Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Rockford, USA) coupled with a nanoLC Ultra (Eksigent, Dublin, USA). Each sample (5 μL) was loaded onto a trap column (C18 PepMap100, 300 μm 1 mm, 5 μm, 100 Å, Dionex, Sunnyvale, USA) at a ﬂow rate of 4 μL/min for 5 min. Peptide separation was carried out on a C18 column (Acclaim PepMap C18, 15 cm  75 μm  3 μm, 100 Å, Dionex) at a ﬂow rate of 0.26 μL/min. Peptides were separated using an 85 min linear gradient ranging from 5% to 40% B. The mass spectrometer was operated in positive ionization mode. The MS survey scan was performed in the FT cell from a mass range of 300 to 1,700 m/z. The resolution was set to 60,000 @ 400 m/z, and the automatic gain control (AGC) was set to 500,000 ions. CID fragmentation was used for MS/MS and the 20 most intense signals in the survey scan were fragmented. An isolation window of 1.5 m/z, and a target value of 10,000 ions was used. Fragmentation was performed with normalized collision energies of 35% and activation times of 30 ms. Dynamic exclusion was performed with a repeat count of 1 and an exclusion duration of 75 s, and a minimum MS signal for triggering MS/MS was set to 5,000 counts. All subsequent replicates (four of six total samples) were analyzed using a TripleTOF 5600 mass spectrometer (AB Sciex, Concord, Canada) coupled to a nanoLC2D (Eksigent, Dublin, OH). Five microliters of each sample was loaded onto a trap column (ChromXp C18, 350µm 0.5mm, 5µm, 120Å, Eksigent, Dublin, USA) at a flow rate of 3 µL/min for 7 min. Peptide separation was carried out on a C18 column (ChromXp C18, 15 cm × 75 μm × 3 μm, 120 Å, Eksigent) at a flow rate of 0.3 L/min. Peptides were separated using a 120 min linear gradient from 5% to 50% B (mobile phase A, 1% formic acid; mobile phase B, 1% formic acid in ACN). The mass spectrometer was operated in positive ionization and high sensitivity mode. The MS survey spectrum was accumulated from a mass range of 380 to 1250 m/z in 250ms. For IDA (information dependent acquisition) MS/MS experiments, the first 20 features above 150 counts threshold and having a charge state of +2 to +5 were fragmented using rolling collision energy +/- 5%, with 100 ms spectra accumulation/experiment. Each MS/MS experiment put the precursor m/z on a 75 s dynamic exclusion list. Auto calibration was performed every 5 samples (9h) to assure high mass accuracy in both MS and MS/MS acquisition.","dataProcessingProtocol":"Orbitrap-Velos raw data were converted to Mascot generic format (.mgf) files by Mascot Daemon 2.4 (Matrix Science, London, UK). TripleTOF 5600 raw data were processed using MS Data Converter (ABSciex) to generate .mgf files. For each replicate, all fractions were merged prior to database search using Mascot Daemon 2.4. All Mascot searches were performed against a combined database (19,603 sequences total) containing the full Phytozome v9.0 database (http://www.phytozome.net/, Dec. 2012) and the NCBI chloroplast and mitochondrion databases using the following settings: trypsin with up to two missed cleavages; carbamidomethylation fixed at Cys; variable oxidation at Met; variable protein N-terminal acetylation, variable deamidation at Asn and Gln; variable phosphorylation at Ser, Thr, and Tyr. The mass error tolerance for precursor ions was set to 10 ppm, 0.08 Da for TripleTOF 5600 fragment ions, and 0.8 Da for Orbitrap-Velos fragment ions. A decoy reverse database search was also performed to estimate the false positive rate of protein identification. Identified proteins were further analyzed with Scaffold (v3.1, Proteome Software Inc., Portland, OR) and Scaffold PTM (v3.1; Proteome Software, Portland, OR) to confirm the identification and phosphorylation sites localization probability. First, Scaffold was used to filter proteins and peptides based on the Protein Prophet (19) and Peptide Prophet (20) algorithms to obtain 99% protein and peptide probability and 1% protein and peptide FDR with at least one peptide matched. Next, Scaffold PTM was used to obtain an estimate of the phosphosite localization probability by assigning Ascores (21) to each PTM call. A Scaffold PTM spectrum report for each search was exported, listing all MS/MS queries with their Ascores for every protein having a 99% or better probability. An Excel Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) program was written to compile the spectrum reports and generate the peptide, protein, and phosphosite tables for all non-redundant proteins. Phosphosites were compiled as follows. 1) All MS/MS queries for each peptide of a protein were counted and the highest Ascore query tabulated; in case of a tie the highest Mascot score query was tabulated. 2) All phosphosites for the protein were tabulated. 3) For each phosphosite, the highest Ascore was sought from all peptides containing the site, including missed cleavage peptides and multiply-modified peptides. 4) Each phosphosite was flagged if its Ascore was 13 or better, connoting a 95% site localization confidence (21-23). 5) Each phosphosite was flagged if its Ascore was 18 or better and its neighboring residues were not Ser, Thr, or Tyr. Phosphosites with neighboring Ser, Thr, or Tyr residues and Ascores of 40 or better were also flagged. The estimated site localization confidence for this more stringent filter is 99% (24). The same VBA program determined the subset of non-redundant phosphosites among all proteins recursively as follows. First, for each site the largest contiguous sequence spanning the site was constructed using only peptides observed as modified at the site with high confidence. With all observed site sequences thus tabulated, each was compared to the rest to cull redundant entries. This processing was based solely on observed peptides and thus was independent of putative protein association. For motif analysis only non-redundant 99% localization confidence sites were considered. A list of 13 residue sequences centered on each site was constructed from its observed largest contiguous sequence. For any site within 6 residues of the N- or C- terminus of its largest contiguous sequence, the VBA program used the inferred protein sequence to extend the site neighborhood to give a phosphosite-centered 13-mer sequence. Sequences were categorized as basic, acidic, proline-directed, tyrosine, or “other” according to the rules of Huttlin and colleagues (23), well-articulated by Lasonder and colleagues (25). Motifs were determined for each category using Motif-X (http://motif-x.med.harvard.edu/motif-x.html2) (26, 27). The background was the IPI Arabidopsis thaliana proteome, the width was set to 13, occurrences set to 20, significance set to 1x10-7, and pT sites replaced at position 7 with pS. For tyrosine motifs the thresholds were relaxed: occurrences set to 5 and significance set to 1x10-6.","otherOmicsLink":null,"numProteins":50884,"numPeptides":930683,"numSpectra":820308,"numUniquePeptides":113202,"numIdentifiedSpectra":820308,"references":[{"desc":"Wang H, Gau B, Slade WO, Juergens M, Li P, Hicks LM.

Using Microsoft Excel, peptides were filtered to identify those with significantly altered L/H ratios at 2 or more consecutive denaturant concentrations. Significantly altered L/H (or H/L) ratios in this work were taken to be those that changed by >1.7-fold from the baseline value observed for each peptide.

Although antibiotic treatments are efficient in the early stage of the infection, a significant number of patients develop disseminated manifestations due to unnoticed or absence of erythema migrans, or to inappropriate treatment. Vaccine could be an efficient approach to decrease Lyme disease incidence. We have developed a proteomic approach based on a Ge-LC-MS/MS strategy to identify new vaccine candidates. We analyzed a disseminating clone and the associated wild type strain for each major pathogenic Borrelia species: B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, B. garinii and B. afzelii. We managed to identify proteins specific and common to the disseminating clones of the 3 main species. In parallel, we used a spectral counting strategy in order to identify up-regulated proteins common to the clones.

Proteins (75 µg) were electrophoresed onto 12% SDS-PAGE and stained overnight with colloidal Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Gel bands of 2 mm were excised manually. In-gel digestion was carried out as previously described, and the tryptic peptides were extracted by the addition of 35 µL of 60% (v/v) ACN and 0.1% (v/v) HCO2H. NanoLC-MS/MS was performed using a nanoLC-Chip/MS (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) hyphenated to an ion trap amaZon (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). The chip contained a Zorbax 300SB-C18 column (150 mm x 75 μm, 5 μm particle size) and a Zorbax 300SB-C18 enrichment column (40 nL, 5 μm particle size). The solvent system consisted of 2% ACN, 0.1% HCO2H in water (solvent A) and 2% water, 0.1% HCO2H in ACN (solvent B). One μL of peptide extract (1/20 of the total volume) was loaded in duplicate into the enrichment column at a flow rate set to 3.75 μL/min with A. Elution was performed at a flow rate of 300 nL/min with a 8-40% linear gradient (solvent B) in 30 min followed by a 4 min stage at 70% of B before reconditioning the column at 8% of B. The MS instrument was operated with the following settings: source temperature was set to 145 °C while cone gas flow was at 4 L/min. The nano-electrospray voltage was set to -1 900 V. The MS spectra were acquired in the positive ion mode on the mass range 250 to 1 500 m/z using the standard enhanced resolution mode at a scan rate of 8 100 m/z/s. The Ion Charge Control was fixed at 200 000 with a maximum accumulation time of 200 ms and the number of averages was set to 2. For tandem MS experiments, the system was operated with automatic switching between MS and MS/MS modes. The 8 most abundant peptides were selected on each MS spectrum for further isolation and fragmentation with a preference for doubly charged ions (absolute threshold of 100 000). Fragmentation was performed using argon as the collision gas. Ions were excluded after the acquisition of one MS/MS spectra and the exclusion was released after 0.60 min. The Smart Parameters Setting option was used for the selected precursor ions. The MS/MS spectra were acquired on the mass range 100 to 2 000 m/z. The Ion Charge Control was fixed at 400 000 and 5 scans were averaged to obtain a MS/MS spectrum.

Searches were performed without any molecular weight, or isoelectric point restrictions against 3 in house generated protein databases composed of protein sequences of B. burgdorferi B31, B. garinii PBi and B. afzelii PKo downloaded from National Center for Biotechnology Information non redundant database (NCBInr, August 16, 2012). Known contaminant proteins such as human keratins and trypsin, were added to each database and concatenated with reversed copies of all sequences (B. burgdorferi B31: 1758 entries; B. garinii PBi: 1720 entries; B. afzelii PKo: 2157 entries). The databases for B. burgdorferi B31 and B. afzelii PKo strains were used as respectively the B. burgdorferi 297 and B. afzelii 163 strains have not been sequenced yet. Trypsin was selected as enzyme and for MS/MS data, a parent and fragment mass tolerance of 0.5 Da. A maximum of 2 missed cleavages was allowed and some modifications were taken into account: carbamidomethyl (C), acetyl N-terminus of protein, oxidation (M). The Mascot and OMSSA results were independently loaded into the Scaffold software (Proteome Software, Portland, OR). The target-decoy database search allowed us to control the false positive identification rate which was set to 1% with a minimum of one peptide per protein.  Duplicate trials were performed for each condition. Spectral counts for each replicate were determined from the number of MS/MS spectra identified from validated proteins by both search engines. The beta binomial test implemented in R was used to determine significantly up-regulated proteins (p value < 0.05) in each virulent clone compared to the wild type strain.  The test was performed independently for both search engines because the spectral identifications are algorithm dependent. We focused on up-regulated proteins that overlap between both search algorithms. All the identifications for each clone in each species can be found in the Supporting Information.","otherOmicsLink":null,"numProteins":30750,"numPeptides":1944129,"numSpectra":6134775,"numUniquePeptides":673495,"numIdentifiedSpectra":1944129,"references":[{"desc":"Schnell G, Boeuf A, Jaulhac B, Boulanger N, Collin E, Barthel C, De Martino S, Ehret-Sabatier L.

Dynein, tubulin, HSP90, HSP70, HSP60, adenosylhomocysteinase, NKEF-B, brain type creatine kinase, mitochondrial ATP synthase, and valosin containing enzyme represent high abundance proteins in carp spermatozoa. These proteins are functionally related to sperm motility and energy production as well as the protection of sperm against oxidative injury and stress. Moreover, carp sperm is equipped with functionally diverse proteins involved in signal transduction, transcription, translation, protein turnover and transport. About 15% of carp sperm proteins identified here were also detected in seminal plasma which may be a result of leakage from spermatozoa into seminal plasma, adsorption of seminal plasma proteins on spermatozoa surface, and expression in both spermatozoa and cells secreting seminal plasma proteins. The availability of a catalogue of carp sperm proteins provides substantial advances for an understanding of sperm function and for future development of molecular diagnostic tests of carp sperm quality, the evaluation of which is currently limited to certain parameters such as sperm count, morphology and motility or viability.","publicationDate":"2014-10-13","submissionType":"COMPLETE","numAssays":4,"species":["Cyprinus carpio (Common carp)"],"tissues":["spermatozoon"],"ptmNames":["monohydroxylated residue"],"instrumentNames":["LTQ"],"projectTags":[],"doi":"10.6019/PXD000877","submitter":{"title":"Dr","firstName":"Mariola ","lastName":"Dietrich","email":"m.dietrich@pan.olsztyn.pl","affiliation":"Polish Academy of Sciences"},"labHeads":[{"title":"Dr","firstName":"Mariola A.","lastName":"Dietrich","email":"m.dietrich@pan.olsztyn.pl","affiliation":"Institute of Animal Reproduction and Food Research, Polish Academy of Sciences, Department of Gamete and Embryo Biology, Olsztyn, Poland"}],"submissionDate":"2014-04-04","reanalysis":null,"experimentTypes":["Shotgun proteomics"],"quantificationMethods":[],"keywords":"carp, sperm, proteome, LC-MS/MS, fish","sampleProcessingProtocol":"Samples with spermatozoa content  >10 x 109 ml-1 and > 80 % motile spermatotoa were selected for proteomic analysis.

The fission yeast stress activated MAP kinase (SAPK) pathway is conserved with the p38 and JNK pathways in humans, and comprises the MAPKKKs Win1, Wis4, the MAPKK Wis1, and the MAPK, Sty1. Sty1 and its main downstream effector Atf1 regulate a large set of core environmental stress response genes. The fission yeast genome encodes three other ATF proteins: Atf21, Atf31 and Pcr1. Among these, atf21 is specifically induced under conditions of high osmolarity. We have therefore instigated a programme to investigate the role played by non coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in response to osmotic stress challenge in wild type and atf21Δ cells. By integrating global proteomics and RNA sequencing data, we identified a systematic program in which elevated antisense RNAs arising both from ncRNAs and from 3'-overlapping convergent gene-pairs is directly associated with substantial reductions in protein levels throughout the fission yeast genome. We also found an extensive array of ncRNAs with trans associations that have the potential to influence different biological processes and stress responses in fission yeast, suggesting ncRNAs comprise additional components of the SAPK regulatory system.","publicationDate":"2014-05-19","submissionType":"COMPLETE","numAssays":1,"species":["Schizosaccharomyces pombe 927"],"tissues":[],"ptmNames":["Oxidation","Deamidated"],"instrumentNames":["LTQ Orbitrap"],"projectTags":["Biological"],"doi":"10.6019/PXD000894","submitter":{"title":"Dr","firstName":"Hui Sun","lastName":"Leong","email":"HuiSun.Leong@cruk.manchester.ac.uk","affiliation":"Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute, The University of Manchester"},"labHeads":[{"title":"Dr","firstName":"Crispin J","lastName":"Miller","email":"crispin.miller@cruk.manchester.ac.uk","affiliation":"RNA Biology Group, Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute, The University of Manchester, Wilmslow Road, Manchester M20 4BX, United Kingdom."}],"submissionDate":"2014-04-11","reanalysis":null,"experimentTypes":["Shotgun proteomics"],"quantificationMethods":[],"keywords":"non-coding RNAs, fission yeast, osmotic stress, label-free quantitative proteomics","sampleProcessingProtocol":"Protein reduction, alkylation and digestion.

Features (peaks) were filtered for charge state (2, 3 and 4 accepted) and elution time window. The resulting MS/MS peak lists were exported as a single Mascot generic file and loaded onto a local Mascot Server (version 2.3.0; Matrix Science). We searched these spectra against the SwissProt/UniProt 2011 database (selected for Schizosaccharomyces pombe) using the following parameters: tryptic enzyme digestion with one missed cleavage allowed, precursor mass tolerance of 10 ppm, fragment mass tolerance of 0.6 Da, oxidation of methionines and deamidation of glutamine/asparagine as variable modifications, ion score significance threshold of p ≤ 0.05. The resulting peptides were exported as an XML file from Mascot and imported back into Progenesis LC-MS to assign peptides to features. A table of all identified features along with their normalized peptide abundance in each sample was generated. In total, 7330 (out of 58211) features have peptide assignments and these peptides belong to 1167 non-redundant proteins. We calculated an abundance measure for each protein by averaging the corresponding normalized peptide abundance. This results in a matrix consisting of 1167 proteins and their respective abundance in each sample (five technical replicate injections were available for each treatment, no biological replicate). This was analyzed in the R/BioConductor package limma (Smyth, 2004) to identify stress-responsive proteins. A protein was considered as significant if its abundance showed differential changes in the stressed cells relative to unstressed cells in at least one time point at 5% FDR.","otherOmicsLink":null,"numProteins":1274,"numPeptides":107916,"numSpectra":121782,"numUniquePeptides":13390,"numIdentifiedSpectra":70595,"references":[{"desc":"Leong HS, Dawson K, Wirth C, Li Y, Connolly Y, Smith DL, Wilkinson CR, Miller CJ.

{"accession":"PXD000899","title":"Cell cycle dependent phosphorylation of transmembrane proteins on the Theileria annulata schizont surface","projectDescription":"The invasion of Theileria sporozoites into bovine leukocytes is rapidly followed by the liberation of the parasite from the parasitophorpous vacuole membrane, allowing the parasite to establish its niche within the host cell cytoplasm. Theileria infection induces host cell transformation, characterised by increased host cell proliferation and invasiveness, and the activation of anti-apoptotic genes.  This process is strictly dependent on the presence of a viable parasite. Several host cell kinases, including PI3-K, PKA, CK2 and Src-family kinases, are known to be constitutively activated in Theileria infected cells and to contribute to the transformed phenotype. A number of host cell molecules, including the IB kinase and polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1), are recruited to the schizont surface, although very little is known about the schizont molecules involved. In this study we used immunofluorescence analysis to detect phosphorylated threonine (p-Thr and p-Thr-Pro) and serine (p-Ser) epitopes on the schizont during host cell cycle progression, revealing extensive schizont surface phosphorylation during host cell interphase. Further, we isolated schizonts from infected macrophages following synchronisation in S-phase or mitosis, and used mass spectrometry to detect phosphorylated schizont proteins. In total, 65 phosphorylated Theileria proteins were detected, 15 of which are potentially secreted or expressed on the surface of the schizont and thus mayight be targets forof host cell kinases. In particular, we describe the cell-cycle stage phosphorylation of two T. annulata surface expressed proteins, TaSP and p104. Phospho-peptides of both proteins were significantly more abundant in schizonts purified from S-phase cells.","publicationDate":"2014-12-12","submissionType":"COMPLETE","numAssays":12,"species":["Theileria annulata"],"tissues":[],"ptmNames":["iodoacetamide derivatized residue","phosphorylated residue","monohydroxylated residue","deamidated residue"],"instrumentNames":["LTQ Orbitrap Velos"],"projectTags":["Biological"],"doi":"10.6019/PXD000899","submitter":{"title":"Dr","firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Xia","email":"d.xia@liv.ac.uk","affiliation":"Infection Biology"},"labHeads":[{"title":"Dr","firstName":"Jonathan","lastName":"Wastling","email":"wasj@liv.ac.uk","affiliation":"Department of Infection Biology  Institute of Infection and Global Health University of Liverpool"}],"submissionDate":"2014-04-14","reanalysis":null,"experimentTypes":["Shotgun proteomics"],"quantificationMethods":[],"keywords":"Theileria annulata schizont, phosphorylation, Cell cycle dependent","sampleProcessingProtocol":"Proteins from whole cell lysate were prepared using in solution trypsin digest.

{"accession":"PXD000994","title":"TurboRAW2MGF: Removing isobaric-related ions improves the peptide/protein identification","projectDescription":"Isobaric labelling technique coupled with high resolution mass spectrometry has been widely employed in the proteomics workflows requiring relative quantification. For each high resolution tandem mass spectrum (MS/MS), it can be used not only to quantify the peptide from different samples by reporter ions，but also to identify the peptide it derived from. Since isobaric related ions act as noises in database searching, the MS/MS spectrum should be preprocessed before peptide/protein identification. In this paper, we demonstrated that there were a lot of high frequency, high abundance isobaric related ions in MS/MS spectrum. By combining removing isobaric related ions with deisotoping and deconvolution in MS/MS preprocessing procedure, the peptide/protein identification sensitivity improved significantly.

{"accession":"PXD001020","title":"Redox-state of pentraxin 3 as a novel biomarker for  resolution of inflammation and survival in sepsis","projectDescription":"In an endotoxaemic mouse model of sepsis, a tissue-based proteomics approach for biomarker discovery identified long pentraxin 3 (PTX3) as the lead candidate for inflamed myocardium. PTX3 accumulated as an octamer due to disulphide-bond formation in heart, kidney and lung ?common organ dysfunctions seen in patients with sepsis. Oligomeric moieties of PTX3 were also detectable in the circulation. The redox-state of PTX3 was quantified over the first 11 days in critically ill adult patients with sepsis. On admission day, there was no difference in the redox-state of PTX3 between survivors and non-survivors. From day 2 onwards, the conversion of octameric to monomeric PTX3 was consistently associated with a greater survival after 28 days of follow-up. For example, by day 2 post admission, octameric PTX3 was undetectable in survivors, but still constituted more than half of total PTX3 in non-survivors (P<0.001). Monomeric PTX3 was inversely associated with cardiac damage markers NT-proBNP, high sensitivity troponin I and T. In comparison to the conventional measurements of total PTX3 or NT-proBNP, the redox-sensitive oligomerization of PTX3 was more dynamic and a superior predictor of disease outcome.","publicationDate":"2014-07-01","submissionType":"COMPLETE","numAssays":384,"species":["Mus musculus (Mouse)"],"tissues":["heart"],"ptmNames":["iodoacetamide derivatized residue","monohydroxylated residue"],"instrumentNames":["LTQ Orbitrap"],"projectTags":["Biomedical"],"doi":"10.6019/PXD001020","submitter":{"title":"Dr","firstName":"Xiaoke","lastName":"Yin","email":"xiaoke.yin@kcl.ac.uk","affiliation":"Cardiovascular Division, King's College London"},"labHeads":[{"title":"Dr","firstName":"Manuel","lastName":"Mayr","email":"manuel.mayr@kcl.ac.uk","affiliation":"King's British Heart Foundation Centre, King's College London, UK"}],"submissionDate":"2014-05-29","reanalysis":null,"experimentTypes":["Bottom-up proteomics"],"quantificationMethods":["Normalized Spectral Abundance Factor - NSAF"],"keywords":"Biomarkers; Host-Pathogen Interaction; Inflammatory response; Prognostic markers; Protein Modification; Serum/Plasma","sampleProcessingProtocol":"The Triton-insoluble fractions from control (n=4) and septic group (n=4) were denatured in Laemmli buffer at 97癈 for 5min. The proteins were separated by 5-20% gradient Tris-glycine gel at 5W for 45min then 30W for 4.5 hours. After electrophoresis, gels were stained using the PlusOne Silver staining Kit (GE Healthcare). Silver staining was used for band staining to avoid cross-contamination with fainter gel bands. All gel bands (n=48 per sample) were excised in identical parallel positions across lanes and no empty gel pieces were left behind. Subsequently, all gel bands were subjected to in-gel tryptic digestion using an Investigator ProGest (Digilab) robotic digestion system. Tryptic peptides were separated on a nanoflow LC system (Dionex Ultimate 3000, Thermo Fisher Scientific) using reversed phase columns (PepMap C18, 25cm x 75um) and eluted with a 40min gradient (10-25% B in 35 min, 25-40% B in 5min, 90% B in 10min, and 2% B in 20min, where A is 2% ACN, 0.1% formic acid in HPLC H2O and B is 90% ACN, 0.1% formic acid in HPLC H2O). Sequentially eluted peptides were directly analysed by tandem mass spectrometry (LTQ Orbitrap XL, Thermo Fisher Scientific) using full ion scan mode over the mass-to-charge (m/z) range 450-1600.

Only tryptic peptides were included in the analysis. Protein identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 99% probability with at least two independent peptides. Proteomic differential expression was assessed using the normalized spectral abundance factor - power law global error model (NSAF-PLGEM). The Normalized Spectral Abundance Factor was calculated for each protein detected. Spectral count values of 0 were replaced by an empirically derived fractional value. The value was calculated to be the smallest value between 0 and 1, which provided the best fit to a normal distribution, as dertermined by a Shapiro-Wilks test. The NASF values were fit to a power-law global error model; differentially expressed proteins were then identified through a signal-to-noise (STN) test statistic. Proteins, which did not have a sufficient number of samples with spectra (less than 2 samples in each group) were removed prior to analysis.","otherOmicsLink":null,"numProteins":47572,"numPeptides":306929,"numSpectra":661515,"numUniquePeptides":116989,"numIdentifiedSpectra":223877,"references":[{"desc":"Cuello F, Shankar-Hari M, Mayr U, Yin X, Marshall M, Suna G, Willeit P, Langley SR, Jayawardhana T, Zeller T, Terblanche M, Shah AM, Mayr M.

After complete drying of a solution containing 50 µg of protein per pooled sample, proteins were reduced with 2 µL of 50 mM tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine by incubation at 60°C for 1 hour. Then, proteins were alkylated with 1 µL of a 15.5 mg/mL solution of 2-iodoacetamide (SigmaUltra, USA, # I1149) at room temperature for 30 min in the dark. Equivalent amounts of serum proteins after depletion constituted a “pooled” sample per group: cancer early stage (CES), cancer late stage (CLS), healthy set 1 and healthy set 2. After washing, the samples were analysed by SDS-PAGE for visual inspection to make sure that protein amount and composition of the depleted serum samples were comparable. Thereafter, the proteins were digested (16 hours) with trypsin (sequencing grade modified trypsin, Promega, USA, # V5111) at a 1:15 enzyme to total protein ratio at 37ºC with vortexing at 450 rpm in a Thermomixer (Eppendorf).

All experiments were performed in accordance with United Kingdom Home Office guidelines under the United Kingdom Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. Animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and gastrocnemius muscles were immediately dissected. A gastrocnemius muscle from each mouse was placed immediately in a thiol blocking buffer containing (25 mM d(0) NEM, 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8) for redox proteomic analysis. Briefly protein extracts for redox analysis were prepared using a hand homogeniser in the presence of thiol blocking buffer containing d(0) NEM under anaerobic conditions. Protein lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 15,000g for 10 minutes at 4 °C and protein concentrations were calculated by Bradford assay (BioRad) using BSA as a standard. Protein extracts for redox analysis were desalted using Zeba spin desalting columns (Thermo) and protein concentrations were re-calculated as before. 200 µg in 160 µl of 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate of the desalted protein extract was denatured by addition of 10 μL of 1% w/v RapiGest™ (Waters, Manchester, UK) in 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate and followed by incubation at 80°C for 10 min. Reversibly oxidized Cys residues were reduced by the addition of 10 µl of 100 mM TCEP and incubated at 60°C for 10 min.

{"accession":"PXD001063","title":"Proteomic analysis of cAMP-mediated signaling during differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes","projectDescription":"Initiation of adipocyte differentiation is promoted by the synergistic action of insulin/insulin-like growth factor, glucocorticoids, and agents activating cAMP-dependent signaling. The action of cAMP is mediated via PKA and Epac, where at least part of the PKA function relates to strong repression of Rho kinase activity, whereas Epac counteracts the reduction in insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling associated with complete repression of Rho kinase activity. However, detailed knowledge of the Epac-dependent branch and the interplay with PKA is still limited. In the present study, we present a comprehensive evaluation of Epac-mediated processes and their interplay with PKA during the initiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation using a combination of proteomics, molecular approaches and bioinformatics. Proteomic analyses revealed 7 proteins specifically regulated in response to Epac activation, 4 in response to PKA activation, and 11 in response to the combined activation by Epac and PKA during the initial phase of differentiation. Network analyses indicated that the identified proteins are involved in pathways of importance for glucose metabolism, inositol metabolism and calcium-dependent signaling thereby adding a novel facet to our understanding of cAMP-mediated potentiation of adipocyte differentiation.","publicationDate":"2014-09-22","submissionType":"COMPLETE","numAssays":1,"species":["Mus musculus (Mouse)"],"tissues":[],"ptmNames":["monohydroxylated residue"],"instrumentNames":["4800 Proteomics Analyzer"],"projectTags":["Biological"],"doi":"10.6019/PXD001063","submitter":{"title":"Mr","firstName":"Kamil","lastName":"Borkowski","email":"kamilborkowski@bio.ku.dk","affiliation":"University of Copenhagen"},"labHeads":[{"title":"Dr","firstName":"Karsten","lastName":"Kristiansen","email":"kk@bio.ku.dk","affiliation":"Copenhagen University"}],"submissionDate":"2014-06-16","reanalysis":null,"experimentTypes":["Shotgun proteomics"],"quantificationMethods":[],"keywords":"cAMP; Epac; adipogenesis; two-dimensional gel electrophoresis","sampleProcessingProtocol":"Samples collection for two-dimensional gel analysis Cells were washed three times with warm (37⁰C) HANK’s buffer and collected by scraping.

Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis To analyze changes in protein expression and/or modification during differentiation, samples collected at day 0, 8 h, 24 h, 48h and day 8 of differentiation were analyzed by two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis. 2D gel electrophoresis was carried out as described. Briefly, the first dimension 18 cm IPG strips, covering a pH gradient from 4 to 7 (IPG 4-7) (GE Healthcare Cat. No. 17-1233-01) were rehydrated in two steps. First strips were rehydrated overnight in 200 μl of sample diluted in lysis buffer (300 μg of protein per gel were loaded). Next, strips were rehydrated for 6 h in 100 μl of lysis buffer. Isoelectric focusing was performed using a linearly increasing profile:  0 V to 600 V for 2:15 h, f600 V to 3500 for 8 h, and 3500 V for 9:25 h.

The second dimension SDS PAGE was performed using the vertical electrophoresis system Protean II™ (BioRad) and 12.5% (w/v) laboratory made acrylamide gels (acrylamide: N,N’-ethylene-bis-acrylamide ratio 200:1). Gels were run overnight at 20oC. 6 mA per gel were applied for the first 2 h of electrophoresis, then 12 mA per gel. The running buffer contained 0.67% Tris-Base, 1.44% of glycine and 1% SDS. Additionally, buffer recirculation was applied. The gels were stained with Sypro Ruby (Invitrogen™ Cat.

Metal reduction in Gram-positive bacteria is poorly understood. Here, we investigated Fe(III) reduction with lactate, a non-fermentable substrate, as the electron donor. Lactate consumption is concomitant to Fe(III) reduction, but does not support significant growth, suggesting that little energy can be conserved from this process and that it may occur fortuitously. D. reducens can reduce both soluble (Fe(III)-citrate) and insoluble (hydrous ferric oxide, HFO) Fe(III). Because physically inaccessible HFO was not reduced, we concluded that reduction requires direct contact under these experimental conditions. This implies the presence of a surface exposed reductase capable of transferring electrons from the cell to the extracellular electron acceptor. With the goal of identifying candidate Fe(III) reductases, we carried out an investigation of the surface proteome (surfaceome) of D. reducens. Cell surface exposed proteins were extracted by trypsin cell shaving or by lysozyme treatment, and analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.","publicationDate":"2014-07-31","submissionType":"COMPLETE","numAssays":36,"species":["Desulfotomaculum reducens (strain MI-1)"],"tissues":["cell suspension culture"],"ptmNames":["Carbamidomethyl","Dehydrated","Ammonia-loss","Phospho","Acetyl","Oxidation"],"instrumentNames":["Q Exactive"],"projectTags":["Biological"],"doi":"10.6019/PXD001072","submitter":{"title":"Mr","firstName":"Romain","lastName":"Hamelin","email":"romain.hamelin@epfl.ch","affiliation":"PCF"},"labHeads":[{"title":"Dr","firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Moniatte","email":"marc.moniatte@epfl.ch","affiliation":"EPFL Proteomics Core Facility"}],"submissionDate":"2014-06-18","reanalysis":null,"experimentTypes":["Shotgun proteomics"],"quantificationMethods":["Spectrum count/molecular weight"],"keywords":"Desulfotomaculum reducens metal-reducing surfaceome","sampleProcessingProtocol":"Analysis of cell wall extracts : Protoplasts were obtained by re-suspending the cell pellets in 2 mL of an enzymatic mix composed of 1 mg/mL lysozyme , mutanolysin and lysostaphin  in sucrose and TRIS buffer, amended with 4-(2-Aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride. The suspensions were incubated at 37 °C and monitored over time by optical microscopy until rod-shaped cells were converted to round bodies by cell wall digestion. After 45 minutes, the majority (>90 %) of the fermentation samples were converted to protoplasts; the iron reduction samples were incubated for 1h, then half the sample was removed for further processing while the rest was incubated for another hour, before further processing, to increase the protoplast yield (~50 %, which did not increase with longer incubations). Protoplasts were harvested by centrifugation at 1000x g for 10 minutes. The supernatant was filtered (0.2 µm pore size, PTFE filters) to remove residual cells or protoplasts. Protein concentration was estimated using the Pierce BCA Protein assay and samples were diluted to the same concentration, then stored at -20 °C until SDS-PAGE was carried out. SDS-PAGE was performed on a 15 % acrylamide gel. Prior to loading the samples on the gel, they were mixed 1:1 v/v with the loading buffer (125 mM Tris buffer at pH 6.8, 4 % SDS, 20 % glycerol, 0.04 % bromophenol blue, freshly amended with 5 % v/v ß-mercaptoethanol, Applichem) and boiled in a water bath for 15 minutes.

Dimethyl Labeling and SAX fractionation of shaved and shed proteins Each sample (10 μg) was reconstituted in 50 μl of 4 M Urea, 10% acetonitrile and buffered with Tris-HCl pH 8.5 to a final concentration of 30 mM. Proteins were reduced in 10 mM DTE at 37°C for 60 min. Cooled samples were subsequently incubated in 40 mM iodoacetamide at 37°C for 45 min in a light-protected environment. Reaction was quenched by addition of DTE to a final concentration of 10 mM. A first digestion step was then performed using Lys-C (1:50 enzyme: protein) for 2 hours at 37°C. After diluting the samples 5-fold, a second digestion step was performed overnight at 37°C using Mass Spectrometry grade trypsin gold (1:50 enzyme: protein) and 10 mM CaCl2. The reaction was stopped by addition of 2 μl of pure FA and peptides were concentrated by vacuum centrifugation to a final volume of 70 μl. Samples were dimethyl-labeled. Three experiments were conducted. In the first experiment, the shed-proteins from fermentation cells sample were labeled with light dimethyl reactants (CH2O + NaBH3CN), the shed-proteins from Fe(III)-reducing cells sample was labeled with medium reactants (CD2O + NaBH3CN); duplicate samples were labeled in opposite ways. In the second experiment the shaved-proteins from the fermentation sample were labeled with light dimethyl reactants, the shaved-proteins from the Fe(III)-reducing sample were labeled with medium reactants; duplicate samples were labeled in opposite ways.  In the last experiment, the proteins shed from the fermentation sample were labeled with light dimethyl reactants, the shaved proteins from the fermentation sample were labeled with medium reactants, and the shaved proteins from the Fe(III)-reducing sample were labeled with heavy methyl reactants (13CD2O + NABH3CN); the labeling was swapped for the duplicates of the latter two samples. As a final step of the labeling procedure, samples were mixed in 1:1:1 (vol:vol:vol- Light: Medium: Heavy) ratio and lyophilized. Strong anion exchange (SAX) fractionation was performed.

Here we show the role the ion channel subunit Piezo1 (FAM38A). Disruption of mouse Piezo1 gene disturbed vascular development and was embryonic lethal within days of the heart beating to cause blood flow. Importance of Piezo channels as sensors of blood flow was indicated by Piezo1 dependence of shear stress-evoked ionic current and calcium influx in endothelial cells and the ability of exogenous Piezo1 to confer shear stress sensitivity on cells that otherwise lacked. Downstream of this calcium influx was proteoase activity and spatial organization of endothelial cells to the polarity of the applied force. Without Piezo1, normal endothelial cell organization was lacking. The data suggest Piezo1 channels as pivotal integrators of vascular architacture with physiological mechanical force.","publicationDate":"2014-08-08","submissionType":"COMPLETE","numAssays":1,"species":["Homo sapiens (Human)"],"tissues":["lung","lung cancer cell line"],"ptmNames":["L-methionine sulfone","phosphorylated residue","iodoacetamide - site C","monohydroxylated residue","acetylated residue","2-pyrrolidone-5-carboxylic acid (Gln)"],"instrumentNames":["LTQ Orbitrap Velos"],"projectTags":["Biomedical"],"doi":"10.6019/PXD001099","submitter":{"title":"Professor","firstName":"David","lastName":"Beech","email":"D.J.Beech@leeds.ac.uk","affiliation":"University of Leeds"},"labHeads":[{"title":"Dr","firstName":"David J.","lastName":"Beech","email":"D.J.Beech@leeds.ac.uk","affiliation":"School of Medicine and Multidisciplinary Cardiovascular Research Centre University of Leeds United Kingdom"}],"submissionDate":"2014-06-30","reanalysis":null,"experimentTypes":["Shotgun proteomics"],"quantificationMethods":["Peak list file URI"],"keywords":"Piezo1, human, mouse, shear stress, label-free, phosphoproteomics, HUVEC, vascular architecture","sampleProcessingProtocol":"Samples were processed by a modified Filter-Aided Sample Preparation method.

The cell density was maintained within the range of 1-10x105 cells/mL. Histones were acid extracted and subjected to chemical derivatization using propionic anhydride and trypsin digestion as previously described (2). Samples were then desalted and injected onto an online nano LC-MS/MS as described in (2).  Nano Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry ─ The samples were loaded onto one of the two instrument setups as shown in Supplemental Table 1, all at 300 nL/min. Histone peptides were resolved on a two-step gradient from 2% ACN to 30% ACN in 0.1% formic acid over 40 minutes, then from 30% ACN to 95% ACN in 0.1% formic acid over 20 minutes.

A histone fasta file is built from the Uniprot human database (57 entries, including H1, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4). Two datasets (noted as HCD_Histone and CID_Histone) are obtained from the same HeLa histone sample. We note that some precursor m/z values exported by the instrument software Xcalibur are not monoisotopic, and some MS/MS spectra are from two or more co-fragmented peptides. Therefore, we use pParse to convert RAW files to MGF files by exporting the monoisotopic peaks of all precursors, including co-eluted precursors (1). The MGF files are searched using pFind, Mascot, Sequest HT in ProteomeDiscoverer, ProteinPilot, and PEAKS. Because OMSSA in COMPASS, X!Tandem in TPP, and Andromeda in MaxQuant have their own input format, we then convert MGF files to TXT files for OMSSA, use ReAdW (2) to convert RAW files to mzXML files for X!Tandem (in which some precursors are calibrated to the monoisotopic but no co-eluted peptides are exported), and use RAW files directly for Andromeda (in MaxQuant the ‘second peptide’ mode can detect some co-eluted peptides).  Search parameters ─ Search parameters are set for all search engines. The version of each search engine is shown in Supplemental Table 2. We set the following search parameters (as shown in Table 1): precursor mass tolerance ±10 ppm, fragment mass tolerance ±0.02 Th for HCD and ±0.4 Th for CID, trypsin only cleaving after arginine and up to 2 miscleavages, peptide N-terminal propionylation (Propionyl[Peptide N-term]/+56.026) as the fixed modification. To obtain more identification for different kinds of peptides, we set seven sets of variable modifications: (1) only Propionyl[K]/+56.026 for unmodified peptides, (2) Propionyl[K]/+56.026 and Acetyl[K]/+42.011 for acetylated peptides, (3) Propionyl[K]/+56.026 and Methyl_Propionyl[K]/+70.042 for mono-methylated peptides, (4) Propionyl[K]/+56.026 and Dimethyl[K]/+28.031 for di-methylated peptides, (5) Propionyl[K]/+56.026 and Trimethyl[K]/+42.047 for tri-methylated peptides, Propionyl[K]/+56.026 and Phospho[ST]/+79.966 for phosphorylated peptides, and all the above modifications for multi-modified peptides. In total we have 112 searches (i.e. two datasets, eight search engines, and seven searches).  Workflow ─ The workflow is shown in Figure 1. Firstly, RAW files are converted to MGF files, TXT files, and mzXML files. Secondly, each search engine searches with separate modifications. Thirdly, search results are filtered for separate modifications. The target-decoy approach is used in most search engines (3), except TPP, which uses probability to filter search results (4). A FDR of less than 1% at the spectra level is used to filter search results. Fourthly, redundant IDs are removed. When there are redundant spectra in different searches for one specific engine, the peptide-spectral matches with higher scores were kept. Lastly, to obtain confident results, all the filtered IDs for different search engines are combined. The number of search engines identifying one specific spectrum is counted, and spectra identified by only one search engine are filtered out.    1. Yuan, Z. F.; Liu, C.; Wang, H. P.; Sun, R.

{"accession":"PXD001162","title":"Analysis low level Hsp90 proteome by SILAC in yeast","projectDescription":"Hsp90 is one of the most abundant and conserved proteins in the cell. Reduced levels or activity of Hsp90 causes defects in many cellular processes and also reveals genetic or non-genetic variation in populations. Despite information about Hsp90 protein-protein interactions, a global view of the Hsp90 regulated proteome in yeast is unavailable. To investigate the degree of dependency of individual yeast proteins on Hsp90, we used the SILAC method coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) to quantify around 4000 proteins in low-Hsp90 cells and observed that 904 proteins were changed in their abundance by more than 1.5 fold. When compared with the transcriptome of the same population of cells, two-thirds of the mis-regulated proteins were observed to be affected post-transcriptionally, of which the majority were down-regulated. Further analyses indicated that the down-regulated proteins are highly conserved and assume central roles in cellular networks with a high number of interacting partners, suggesting that Hsp90 buffers genetic or non-genetic variation through regulating protein network hubs. The down-regulated proteins were enriched for essential proteins previously unknown to be Hsp90-dependent. Finally, we observed that down-regulation of transcription factors and mating pathway components by attenuating Hsp90 function led to decreased target gene expression and pheromone response respectively, providing a direct link between observed proteome regulation and cellular phenotypes.","publicationDate":"2014-10-24","submissionType":"COMPLETE","numAssays":3,"species":["Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker's yeast)"],"tissues":["cell culture"],"ptmNames":["iodoacetamide derivatized residue","deaminated residue","monohydroxylated residue","6x(13)C labeled residue","acetylated residue"],"instrumentNames":["LTQ Orbitrap Elite"],"projectTags":["Biological"],"doi":"10.6019/PXD001162","submitter":{"title":"Mr","firstName":"Scott","lastName":"Schuyler","email":"schuyler@mail.cgu.edu.tw","affiliation":"Chang Gung University"},"labHeads":[{"title":"Dr","firstName":"Scott C.","lastName":"Schuyler","email":"schuyler@mail.cgu.edu.tw","affiliation":"Department of Biomedical Sciences, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Tao-Yuan Taiwan"}],"submissionDate":"2014-07-22","reanalysis":null,"experimentTypes":["Shotgun proteomics"],"quantificationMethods":["SILAC"],"keywords":"Yeast, Hsp90, Proteome, SILAC","sampleProcessingProtocol":"Normal and heavy SILAC-labeled yeast cells were mixed in a 1:1 ratio of cell numbers. The cells were resuspended in the lysis buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 10 mM NaCl, 1 mM PMSF, and 1 mM DTT) and lysed using 0.5 mm glass beads with 5 beating cycles of 30 second-working and 30 second-cooling. To the mixture, 0.1% SDS was added and mixed by vortexing. All the above steps were performed at 4°C. The cell lysate was ultracentrifuged to remove the undissolved materials, and the protein was quantified using bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (BCA1, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). We aliquoted protein samples into 50 μg/each tube, and stored them at -80°C before MS analysis.  Trypsin digestion and sample clean-up Samples containing 50 μg protein were dissolved in 20 μL of 50 mM NH4HCO3 containing 0.1% SDS. Each sample was reduced by 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) at 56°C for 30 min and then alkylated by 15 mM iodoacetamide at room temperature for 30 min. Excess iodoacetamide was quenched by additional 5 mM DTT at room temperature for 30 min. The solution was then brought to 200 μL with 10 mM NH4HCO3, and digestion was performed in the presence of 0.5 μg trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) at 37°C overnight. The resulting peptide mixture was cleaned-up by a SOURCE 15RPC reverse phase (RP) micro-column (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) and dried in a SpeedVac concentrator.  Online 2-Dimensional Liquid Chromatography The comprehensive 2D-SCX-RP-LC system (Ultimate 3000, Thermo Fisher Scientific/Dionex, Germering, Germany) has been equipped with two gradient pumps (one for first and the other for second dimensional separation), one isocratic pump, one 10-port valve (installed with two RP-trapping columns) and one 6-port valve. The online two-dimensional peptide separation was achieved by operating both gradient pumps simultaneously and switching the 10-port valve every 65 min during the entire analysis. Briefly, protein digests dissolved in 50% acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid were loaded onto the SCX column (0.5 x 150 mm, pack with Luna-SCX particles from Phenomenex, Torrance, CA), which was operated at a flow rate of 1.5 μL/min. Peptides were eluted using a continuous concentration gradient of ammonium chloride in the presence of 0.1% formic acid and 30% acetonitrile. The salt gradient was segmented in 44 steps, 65 min for each, and eluted peptides from each step were then separated by the second dimensional reverse phase column (0.075 x 150 mm, pack with Synergi Hydro-RP particles from Phenomenex). The isocratic pump delivering 70 μL/min of solvent A (0.1% formic acid in water) was used for diluting the effluent of SCX column through a T-union and mixing tubing before it reached the trapping column (0.5 x 5 mm, packed with Symmetry300TM particles from Waters, Milford, MA). In the meantime, the other RP-trapping column was connected to the RP-analytical column and the effluent was analyzed by a mass spectrometer. Five minutes before each salt gradient step being completed, the gradient pump for the SCX separation stopped, and the six-port valve switched to allow the isocratic pump to wash away the residual salt solution in the RP-trapping column. The peptide-loaded trapping column was then switched to the RP analytical column to start a new step of separation, and the bound peptides were eluted at a flow rate of 300 nL/min with a complete acetonitrile gradient (elution, regeneration, and then re-equilibration) in the presence of 0.1% formic acid over 65 min.  Mass spectrometry The effluent of the on-line 2D LC system was analyzed by an Orbitrap EliteTM Hybrid Ion Trap-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron, Bremen, Germany) equipped with a Nanospray Flex Ion Source. The instrument was operated in positive ion mode and the spray voltage was set to 1.8 kV. Full-scan MS spectra (m/z 400-m/z 2000) were acquired in the Orbitrap mass analyzer at a resolution of 60,000 at m/z 400, and the MS/MS spectra were acquired in the linear ion trap (LTQ). The m/z 445.1200, 462.1466, and 536.1654 cyclosiloxane peaks were used for lock mass calibration in the Orbitrap to improve mass accuracy. The values of automatic gain control (AGC) and the maximum accumulation times were 2e6 and 1000 ms for orbitrap, and 3000 and 120 ms for LTQ analyzer, respectively. Acquisition of MS/MS spectra was done in a data-dependent manner. Fifteen most intense ions in each full-scan MS spectrum with a minimal signal intensity of 5,000 were selected for collision induced fragmentation (CID) in LTQ with the following parameter settings: isolation width of 2.0 Da, normalized collision energy of 35%, activation Q of 0.25, and activation time of 10 ms. Each precursor ion was allowed to be sequenced once and then excluded dynamically for 40 seconds.","dataProcessingProtocol":"MS data Analysis The raw files were processed using the Proteome Discoverer software (version 1.3, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). The CID spectra were searched against the UniProt database through Mascot search engine (version 2.2.2, Matrix Science Inc., Boston, MA). The search parameters were as follows: enzyme specificity was trypsin; a maximum of two miscleavages were allowed; precursor mass tolerance was 10 ppm; fragment mass tolerance was 0.6 Da; 13C6 L-Lys, 13C6 L-Arg, acetylation at protein N-terminus, glutamine to pyroglutamic acid conversion at peptide N-terminus, and methionine oxidation were set as variable modifications; and cysteine carbamidomethylation was set as a fixed modification. False discovery rate (FDR) of peptide/protein identifications were determined by employing a decoy database searching. Peptide identifications were then filtered with the requirements of rank 1 peptides with a minimum peptide length of seven amino acid residues. Only high confident peptide/protein identifications (FDR < 1%) were considered for further evaluation.  Protein quantification was done with a SILAC workflow implemented in the Proteome Discover using the following parameters: limits of mass and retention differences between heavy and light pairs should be smaller than 4 ppm and 0.2 min, respectively; only unique peptides were used for quantification; and protein ratio was determined using the median of the corresponding peptide ratio. Finally, functional annotation of each identified protein was retrieved from the ProteinCenter server (Thermo Scientific).  To investigate the proteomic effects caused by the dox treatment, we determined fold changes of SILAC signals upon dox treatment for all the identified proteins. First, the fold-changes were indicated as signal ratios of heavy-/light-labeled peptides (H/L). For one protein identity, we considered the median H/L ratio to represent the fold-change. Second, we normalized all of the fold changes with the median fold-change and log2-transformed the normalized fold change. Finally, we plotted the transformed data. To validate the reproducibility of the replicate SILAC experiment, we plotted fold-changes of the two experiments against each other to calculate the Pearson's correlation coefficient (Figure S2). We also considered the median SILAC signals (H/L for the 1st SILAC and L/H for the 2nd) of untreated/treated cells to represent the fold-change. We first log2-transformed the raw data of fold-changes and then plotted the transformed data.","otherOmicsLink":null,"numProteins":16529,"numPeptides":518817,"numSpectra":1116909,"numUniquePeptides":95409,"numIdentifiedSpectra":344337,"references":[{"desc":"Gopinath RK, You ST, Chien KY, Swamy KB, Yu JS, Schuyler SC, Leu JY.

{"accession":"PXD001174","title":"Un-conditioned commercial embryo culture media contain a large variety of non-declared proteins: a comprehensive proteomics analysis","projectDescription":"Study question: Which non-declared proteins (proteins not listed on the composition list of the product data sheet) are present in unconditioned commercial embryo culture media?  Summary answer: A total of 110 non-declared proteins were identified in unconditioned media and between 6 and 8 of these were quantifiable.   What is known already: There are no data in the literature on what non-declared proteins are present in un-conditioned (fresh media in which no embryos have been cultured) commercial embryo media.  Study design, size, duration: The following eight commercial embryo culture media were included in this study: G-1 PLUS and G-2 PLUS G5 Series from Vitrolife, Sydney IVF Cleavage Medium and Sydney IVF Blastocyst Medium from Cook Medical and EmbryoAssist, BlastAssist, Sequential Cleav and Sequential Blast from ORIGIO. Two batches were analysed for each of the Sydney IVF media and one batch from each of the other media. All embryo culture media are supplemented by the manufacturers with purified human serum albumin (HSA 5 mg/ml). The purified HSA (HSA-solution from Vitrolife) and the recombinant human albumin supplement (G-MM from Vitrolife) were also analysed.   Participants/materials, setting, methods: For protein quantification, media samples were in-solution digested with trypsin and analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). For in-depth protein identification, media were albumin depleted, dialyzed and concentrated before sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gel was cut into 14 slices followed by in-gel trypsin digestion, and analysis by LC-MS/MS. Proteins were further investigated using gene ontology (GO) terms analysis.  Main results and the role of chance: Using advanced mass spectrometry and high confidence criteria for accepting proteins (p< 0.01), a total of 110 proteins other than HSA were identified. The average serum albumin content was found to be 94% (92% - 97%) of total protein. Other individual proteins accounted for up to 4.7% of the total protein. Analysis of purified HSA strongly suggests that these non-declared proteins are introduced to the media when the albumin is added. GO analysis showed that many of these proteins have roles in defence pathways, for example 18 were associated with the innate immune response and 17 with inflammatory responses. Eight proteins have been reported previously as secreted embryo proteins.  Limitations, reasons for caution: For six of the commercial embryo culture media only one batch was analyzed. However, this does not affect the overall conclusions.  Wider implications of the findings: The results showed that the HSA added to IVF media contained many other proteins and that the amount varies from batch to batch. These variations in protein profiles are problematic when attempting to identify proteins derived from the embryos. Therefore, when studying the embryo secretome and analysing conditioned media with the aim of finding potential biomarkers that can distinguish normal and abnormal embryo development, it is important that the medium used in the experimental and control groups is from the same batch. Furthermore, the proteins present in un-conditioned media could potentially influence embryonic development, gestation age, birthweight and perhaps have subsequent effects on health of the offspring.","publicationDate":"2014-09-01","submissionType":"COMPLETE","numAssays":58,"species":["Homo sapiens (Human)"],"tissues":[],"ptmNames":["iodoacetamide derivatized residue","monohydroxylated residue","S-carboxamidoethyl-L-cysteine"],"instrumentNames":["TripleTOF 5600"],"projectTags":["Biomedical"],"doi":"10.6019/PXD001174","submitter":{"title":"Dr","firstName":"Thomas F.","lastName":"Dyrlund","email":"tfd@mb.au.dk","affiliation":"Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics"},"labHeads":[{"title":"Dr","firstName":"Jan J.","lastName":"Enghild","email":"jje@mb.au.dk","affiliation":"Aarhus University"}],"submissionDate":"2014-07-25","reanalysis":null,"experimentTypes":["Shotgun proteomics"],"quantificationMethods":[],"keywords":"IVF, culture media, embryo, secretome, proteomics, LC-MS/MS","sampleProcessingProtocol":"Media G-1 PLUS (Lot: 504328), G-2 PLUS (Lot: 504332), G-MM (Lot: 017087) and HSA-solution (Lot: 017077) were all from the G5 Series from Vitrolife. Sydney IVF Cleavage Medium (Lot: K11935 and 512913) and Sydney IVF Blastocyst Medium (Lot: K11927 and 512892) were from Cook Medical.

In-solution digestion A total of 100 µg total protein of each media sample was lyophilized and re-dissolved in 25 µl 8 M urea 0.2 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, reduced and alkylated by adding 15 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) followed by the addition of 30 mM iodoacetamide. Both reactions were allowed to continue for 1 h. The samples were subsequently diluted 5 times with 0.1 M Tris-HCL pH 8.3 and digested using 1:50 w/w trypsin (Sigma) at 37 °C for 16 h. From each sample, 20 µg was desalted using Poros 50 R2 reverse phase column material (PerSeptive Biosystems) packed in GELoader Tips (Eppendorf), dried in a vacuum centrifuge, dissolved in 0.1% formic acid and stored at 4 °C before liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) analysis.  Albumin depletion A total of 5 ml (~25 mg serum albumin) Sydney IVF Cleavage Medium (Cook Medical, Lot: K11935) or 0.5 ml (~25 mg serum albumin) G-MM recombinant human serum albumin (HSA) supplement (Vitrolife, Lot: 017087) was diluted 4 times in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), pH 7.4 (loading buffer) and applied to a 1 ml column containing the recombinant albumin-binding domain of streptococcal protein G (Kronvall, et al., 1979) equilibrated in loading buffer. To prevent exceeding the albumin binding capacity of the column (30 mg/ml), each diluted medium sample was divided in five fractions and each fraction was depleted separately. The flow through was collected for each run, and the column regenerated in between using wash buffer (20 mM Na-citrate, 150 mM NaCl, pH 2.5). Flow through for all runs were pooled for each media and dialyzed overnight into 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The depleted and dialyzed media was then concentrated using a 15 ml Centriprep 10K centrifugal filter (Merck Millipore Ltd) to a volume of 0.5 ml before being lyophilized using a speedvac (Savant) to a final volume of 50 µl.  Protein separation by SDS-PAGE and in-gel digestion The albumin-depleted samples were boiled for 5 min in sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) sample buffer containing 50 mM DTT, separated by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) using a 5-15% (w/v) gel (Bury, 1981) and stained using Coomassie blue (RAPIDstain, G-Biosciences). The gel was cut into 14 slices, these were washed 3 times in milli-Q water and incubated two times 15 min in 130 μL 50% acetonitrile, dehydrated in 130 μL acetonitrile for 15 min and equilibrated in 150 μL 0.1 M NH4HCO3 for 5 min before 150 μL acetonitrile was added. After 15 min the supernatants were removed and the gel pieces were lyophilized for 20 min. In-gel digestions were performed by digesting the gel pieces with trypsin (Sigma) using a 1:50 (w/w) ratio in 50 mM NH4HCO3 at 37 °C for 16 h. The resulting peptides were desalted using Poros 50 R2 reverse phase column material (PerSeptive Biosystems) packed in GELoader Tips (Eppendorf), dried in a vacuum centrifuge, dissolved in 0.1% formic acid and stored at 4 °C before LC–MS/MS analysis.  LC-MS/MS analysis LC-MS/MS analyses were performed on an EASY-nLC II system (Thermo Scientific) connected to a TripleTOF 5600+ mass spectrometer (AB Sciex) equipped with a NanoSpray III source (AB Sciex) and operated under Analyst TF 1.6.0 control. The samples were injected, trapped, and desalted isocratically on a Biosphere C18 precolumn (ID 100 µm x 2 cm, 5 µm, 120 Å, NanoSeparation, Nieuwkoop, Netherlands). Next, the peptides were eluted from the trap column and separated on a 15 cm analytical column (75 μm i.d.), which was pulled in-house on Polymicro silica tubing by a P2000 laser puller (Sutter Instrument Co.), and packed in-house with ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ 3 μm resin (Dr. Marisch GmbH, Ammerbuch-Entringen, Germany). Peptides were eluted at a flow rate of 250 nl/min using a 50 min gradient from 5% to 35% phase B (0.1% formic acid and 90% acetonitrile), followed by re-equilibration for 10 min back to the starting conditions.","dataProcessingProtocol":"Protein Identification The collected MS files were converted to Mascot generic format (MGF) using the AB SCIEX MS Data Converter beta 1.3 (AB SCIEX) and the \"proteinpilot MGF\" parameters. The peak lists were used to interrogate the Swiss-Prot (version 2014_01, 542,258 sequences) Homo sapiens (20,273 sequences) database or the Swiss-Prot Fungi (31,056 sequences) database using Mascot 2.3.02 (Matrix Science) (Perkins, et al., 1999). Trypsin was employed as enzyme allowing one missed cleavage. Propionamide was entered as a fixed modification for in-gel digests and carbamidomethyl for in-solution digests, whereas oxidation of methionine, and hydroxylation of proline were entered as variable modifications. The mass accuracy of the precursor and product ions were 10 ppm and 0.2 da, and the instrument setting was specified as ESI-QUAD-TOF. The significance threshold (p) was set at 0.01 and the ion score expect cut-off at 0.005. Mascot results were parsed using MS Data Miner v. 1.2.2 (Dyrlund, et al., 2012) accepting only protein hits identified based on three or more unique peptides with expected ion values equal to or lower than 0.005. All keratin contaminants were removed from the final protein lists. MS Data Miner was further used to extract Gene Ontology (GO) information for all identified proteins. Note that since proteins are annotated with several GO terms, they can be represented in multiple GO summary categories.  Protein quantification Proteins were quantified based on the average MS signal response for the three most intense tryptic peptides for each protein (Silva, et al., 2006). In short, the MS files were searched as listed above and the Mascot .dat result files were used to generate a spectral library in Skyline v. 2.1.0.4936 (MacLean, et al., 2010) using the human sequences from Swiss-Prot as background proteome. Employing the same parameters as for the Mascot search, the three most abundant peptides for each protein were manually chosen from all peptides available in the spectral library. After data import, the chromatographic traces (extracted ion chromatograms) were manually inspected and adjusted where needed due to wrongfully assigned peaks. Proteins identified with less than 3 peptides were not included in the quantitation. The relative abundance and standard deviation of proteins quantified in all four of the technical replicates was calculated as the average MS intensity for the three peptides for each protein divided by the sum of the average signal for all quantified proteins in the sample.","otherOmicsLink":null,"numProteins":2117,"numPeptides":68651,"numSpectra":281408,"numUniquePeptides":9519,"numIdentifiedSpectra":55104,"references":[{"desc":"Dyrlund TF, Kirkegaard K, Poulsen ET, Sanggaard KW, Hindkjær JJ, Kjems J, Enghild JJ, Ingerslev HJ.

Mascot searches (Perkins et al., 1999) under Mascot Daemon (Matrix Science, Boston, MA, USA) were conducted with the following parameters: trypsin digestion allowing for up to two missed cleavages, methionine oxidation and iTRAQ on N-termini and lysines, iTRAQ 8-plex quantification, 10 ppm tolerance for MS and MS/MS, peptide charges of +1, +2, and +3, and monoisotopic masses. Plant protein, cysteine modification with methyl methanethiosulfate, fixed iTRAQ modification of free amine in the N-terminus and lysine, and variable iTRAQ modifications of tyrosine were considered. ProteoIQ2.7 (PREMIER Biosoft, Palo Alto, CA, USA) was used to cluster peptides to proteins (protein groups) and output lists of proteins having a minimum peptide probability of >0.95 and a minimum protein probability of <0.95 from all search results for final identification at a 5% false discovery rate (FDR; for comparison of FDRs, see Supplementary Fig. S2) (Tang et al., 2008). Systematic bias was corrected from non-redundant spectrum per peptide from all three search algorithms by using intensity normalization of protein quantification across samples by ProteoIQ2.7 (PREMIER Biosoft).

{"accession":"PXD001210","title":"An Enhanced in vivo SILAC model for Quantification of Drug Metabolism Enzymes","projectDescription":"Many of the enzymes involved in xenobiotic metabolism are maintained at a low basal level and are only synthesized in response to activation of upstream sensor/effector proteins. This induction can have implications in a variety of contexts, particularly during the study of the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and drug-drug interaction profile of a candidate therapeutic compound. Previously, we combined in vivo SILAC material with a targeted high resolution single ion monitoring (tHR/SIM) LC-MS/MS approach for quantification of 197 peptide pairs, representing 51 drug metabolism enzymes (DME), in mouse liver. However, as important enzymes (for example, cytochromes P450 (Cyp) of the 1a and 2b subfamilies) are maintained at low or undetectable levels in the liver of unstimulated metabolically-labelled mice, quantification of these proteins was unreliable. In the present study, we induced DME expression in labelled mice through synchronous ligand-mediated activation of multiple upstream nuclear receptors, thereby enhancing signals for proteins including Cyps 1a, 2a, 2b, 2c and 3a. With this enhancement, 115 unique, lysine-containing, Cyp-derived peptides were detected in the liver of a single animal, as opposed to 56 in a pooled sample from three uninduced animals. A total of 386 peptide pairs were quantified by tHR/SIM, representing 68 Phase I, 30 Phase II and 8 control proteins. This method was employed to quantify changes in DME expression in the hepatic cytochrome P450 reductase null (HRN) mouse. We observed compensatory induction of several enzymes, including Cyps 2b10, 2c29, 2c37, 2c54, 2c55, 2e1, 3a11 and 3a13, carboxylesterase (Ces) 2a and glutathione S-transferases (Gst) m2 and m3, along with down-regulation of hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (Hsd) 11b1 and 17b6.

The supernatant containing protein for analysis was removed, aliquoted and stored at -80°C until use. Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 12% bis-tris gel analysis in MOPS running buffer supplemented with antioxidant (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK). A total of 30 and 20 µg protein was loaded into each well for 10 and 3 fraction analysis, respectively. Gels were stained with Coomassie blue R250, destained, then rehydrated. Each gel lane was cut into two bands (Band 1: 80 – 40 kDa, Band 2: 40 – 0 kDa), with a clean scalpel. These were sliced finely (ca. 1 x 1 mm cubes) and collected in 1.5 mL protein LoBind Eppendorf tubes (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). In-gel trypsin-mediated protein digest and extraction of peptides was carried out according to the method of Shevchenko and colleagues (doi: 10.1038/nprot.2006.468). Peptide sample concentration was determined by measurement of A280 on a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and adjusted to 0.2 mg/mL in water containing 0.1% (vol/vol) trifluoroacetic acid and 2% (vol/vol) acetonitrile.","dataProcessingProtocol":"Protein and peptide database search was carried out using PEAKS version 6 (Bioinformatics Solutions, Waterloo, Canada) with the UniprotKB mus musculus (taxid: 10090) reference proteome set (43,238 entries, downloaded 25.02.14). The precursor mass tolerance was set at 7 ppm and fragment ion mass tolerance set at 0.5 amu. Cysteine carbamidomethylation was selected as a fixed modification. SILAC lysine K6 was selected as a fixed modification when metabolically-labeled tissue was under study. Methionine was selected as a variable modification. A maximum of 2 miscleavages were allowed. Quantification of the predefined targeted peptides was carried out using SIEVE version 2.0 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using two seed files, depending on the molecular weight region of the gel being analysed, containing retention time and m/z information. The precursor mass tolerance was set to 5 ppm and the minimal intensity for alignment was set automatically, with intensities derived from the first monoisotopic peak. Data from SIEVE were exported to Excel 2010 (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) for calculation of light to heavy peptide ratios. A nanoflow liquid chromatograph (Agilent 1200, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) with a LTQ-Orbitrap XL (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to analyze the protein digests. Approximately 0.4 µg total peptide was loaded onto a trap column at a flow rate of 10 µL/min for 3 min and the flow was then reversed to an Agilent Zorbex nano C18 column (0.0075 mm ID; 15 cm; 3 µm particle size). The peptides were resolved with a 3 hr binary gradient at a flow rate of 300 nL/min as follows: 0% Buffer B for 5 min followed by 2-30% Buffer B for 140 min, 30-90% Buffer B for 15 min, 90-0% Buffer B for 10 min and 0% Buffer B for 10 min. Buffer A contained 2% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid in water and Buffer B contained 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. The column was periodically cleaned with a 2 µL injection of buffer containing 50% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid in water. A Proxeon nanospray source with a stainless steel emitter (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to interface the Agilent nanoLC and LTQ-Orbitrap. Spray voltage was set at 1.8kV. The Orbitrap was tuned using Glu-Fibrinogen B peptide. For the protein/peptide identification, a method that consisted of full scans between 330-1500 a.m.u (in Orbitrap) and data dependent MS/MS with top 6 precursor ions (2+ to 4+ charged) in LTQ was employed. Orbitrap was operated in a profile mode at the resolution of 30,000 or 60,000 with a lock mass set at 445.1200 (polycyclodimethylsiloxane (doi: 10.1074/mcp.T500030-MCP200)), LTQ was operated in a centroid mode with isolation width =1 (m/z), normalized collision energy = 0.25, and activation time = 30 ms. The max fill time for Orbitrap and LTQ were set at 500ms and 50ms, respectively. A dynamic exclusion of 30 sec was used to maximize the acquisition of MS2 on peptides with lower intensity. For tHR/SIM analysis, a method that consisted of full scans between 330-1500 a.m.u (in Orbitrap) and data dependent MS/MS scans with or without defined precursors was employed. A dynamic exclusion of 30 sec and a threshold of 500 counts to trigger MS2 were also applied for MS/MS scans. Non-targeted data dependent MS/MS was performed when there was no targeted precursor found in the MS scan.","otherOmicsLink":null,"numProteins":4830,"numPeptides":87129,"numSpectra":168707,"numUniquePeptides":20359,"numIdentifiedSpectra":58503,"references":[{"desc":"MacLeod AK, Fallon PG, Sharp S, Henderson CJ, Wolf CR, Huang JT.

{"accession":"PXD001212","title":"A mammalian transcription factor-specific peptide repository for targeted proteomics","projectDescription":"Site-specific transcription factors (TFs) play an essential role in mammalian development and function as they are vital for the majority of cellular processes. Despite their biological importance, TF proteomic data is scarce in the literature, likely due to difficulties in detecting peptides as the abundance of TFs in cells tends to be low. In recent years, significant improvements in mass spectrometry (MS)-based technologies in terms of sensitivity and specificity have increased the interest in developing quantitative methodologies specifically targeting relatively lowly abundant proteins such as TFs in mammalian models. Such efforts would be greatly aided by the availability of TF peptide-specific information as such data would not only enable improvements in speed and accuracy of protein identifications, but also ameliorate cross-comparisons of quantitative proteomics data and allow for a more efficient development of targeted proteomics assays. However, to date, no comprehensive TF proteotypic peptide database has been developed. To address this evident lack of TF peptide data in public repositories, we are generating a comprehensive, experimentally derived TF proteotypic peptide spectral library dataset based on in vitro protein expression. Our library currently contains peptide information for 89 TFs, and this number is set to increase in the near future.","publicationDate":"2015-01-23","submissionType":"COMPLETE","numAssays":172,"species":["Mus musculus (Mouse)"],"tissues":[],"ptmNames":["Carbamidomethyl","Dehydrated","Ammonia-loss","Acetyl","Oxidation"],"instrumentNames":["LTQ Orbitrap"],"projectTags":["Highlighted","Biological"],"doi":"10.6019/PXD001212","submitter":{"title":"Mr","firstName":"Romain","lastName":"Hamelin","email":"romain.hamelin@epfl.ch","affiliation":"PCF"},"labHeads":[{"title":"Dr","firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Moniatte","email":"marc.moniatte@epfl.ch","affiliation":"EPFL Proteomics Core Facility"}],"submissionDate":"2014-08-08","reanalysis":null,"experimentTypes":["Shotgun proteomics"],"quantificationMethods":[],"keywords":"transcription factor , repository for targeted proteomics, quantitative proteomics, Proteotypic peptide selection","sampleProcessingProtocol":"122 selected TFs containing a GST tag at their C-terminus were expressed in vitro utilizing a TnT SP6 High Yield Wheat Germ Protein Expression System (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

The sepharose beads were then washed three times with a saline buffer (50 mM tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 2mM EDTA, 0.1% NP-40, 10% glycerol) and boiled at 95°C for 5 min in a protein loading buffer to elute the fusion proteins prior to a centrifugation step at 6’000 rpm for 30 s. Subsequently, the supernatant fraction was separated by SDS-PAGE in a 10% resolving gel (Tris-Glycine) and stained with silver nitrate for visualization of the TF fusion protein-belonging bands. In vitro–expressed proteins were in-gel digested using trypsin as follows: the samples were reduced in 10 mM dithioerythritol (DTE) and alkylated in 55 mM iodoacetamide (IAA) before being dried. The samples were then incubated with 12.5 μg/ml of trypsin (in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.5) overnight at 37 °C.

Next, 20 μl of 250 mM iodoacetamide in 50 mM NH4HCO-3 were added and samples were incubated at room temperature in the dark for 30 min. The alkylation reactions were quenched by the addition of an additional 20 μl of 250 mM DTT and the samples were split into 2 x 125 μl aliquots and transferred onto 10 kDa MWCO spin filters. Samples were centrifuged for 20 min at 14,000 x g then washed with 2 x 200 μl of 50 mM NH4HCO3 in the same manner.Trypsin and chymotrypsin solutions were prepared by adding 1000 μl of 50 mM NH4HCO3 to 20 μg and 25 μg lyophilized protein, respectively.

{"accession":"PXD001286","title":"The dynamics of protein-bound methionine oxidation events in Arabidopsis thaliana during oxidative stress","projectDescription":"Reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide can modify proteins via direct oxidation of their sulfur-containing amino acids, cysteine and methionine. Methionine oxidation, studied here, is a reversible posttranslational modification, which is increasingly suggested as a mechanism by which proteins perceive oxidative stress and function in redox signalling. Identification of proteins with oxidized methionines is a first prerequisite towards understanding the functional effect of methionine oxidation on proteins and the biological processes in which they are involved. Here, we  describe a proteome-wide study of in vivo protein-bound methionine oxidation in plants upon oxidative stress, using Arabidopsis thaliana catalase 2 knock-out plants as a model system. We identified approximately 500 sites of oxidation in about 400 proteins, and quantified the differences in oxidation between wild-type and catalase 2 knock-out plants. Further, by sampling over time, we mapped the dynamics of methionine oxidation and gained new insights into this complex and dynamic landscape of the part of the plant proteome that is sculpted by oxidative stress.","publicationDate":"2015-03-24","submissionType":"COMPLETE","numAssays":2,"species":["Arabidopsis thaliana (Mouse-ear cress)"],"tissues":["leaf"],"ptmNames":["N6-propanoyl-L-lysine","L-methionine (S)-sulfoxide","propanoyl labeling reagent heavy form (+3amu) (K)","S-carboxymethyl-L-cysteine","2-pyrrolidone-5-carboxylic acid (Gln)","propanoyl labeling reagent light form (N-term)","N-acetylated residue"],"instrumentNames":["LTQ Orbitrap Velos"],"projectTags":["Biological"],"doi":"10.6019/PXD001286","submitter":{"title":"Mr","firstName":"Jonathan","lastName":"Vandenbussche","email":"jonathan.vandenbussche@vib-ugent.be","affiliation":"Biochemistry"},"labHeads":[{"title":"Dr","firstName":"Kris","lastName":"Gevaert","email":"kris.gevaert@vib-ugent.be","affiliation":"VIB, department of Medical Protein Research Ugent, department of Biochemistry"}],"submissionDate":"2014-09-04","reanalysis":null,"experimentTypes":["Bottom-up proteomics"],"quantificationMethods":[],"keywords":"Arabidopsis Thaliana, oxidative stress, methionine oxidation, catalase mutant","sampleProcessingProtocol":"Proteins were extracted from 0.5 g of grinded tissue by adding 0.5 ml of 250 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.7) containing 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1 M guanidinium hydrochloride, 1% 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propane-sulfonic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) and the appropriate amount of the Complete Protease Inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Applied Science). After centrifugation at 16,100 x g for 10 min twice, protein concentrations were measured using the Bradford assay. By adding the appropriate volumes of extraction buffer, the protein concentration of all samples was adjusted to 1.2 mg/ml. Then, cysteines were reduced and alkylated in 10 mM triscarboxyethylphosphine (Pierce) and 20 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich) upon incubation in the dark for 30 min at 30°C. Samples were subsequently desalted on a NAPTM-5 column (Amersham Biosciences) in 1 ml of 50 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8), heated for 10 min at 95°C and cooled on ice before adding sequencing-grade endoproteinase Lys-C (Promega) in a ratio of 1:200 (enzyme:substrate, w:w) to digest the samples overnight at 37°C.  Next, primary α- and ε-amines were labeled with N-hydroxysuccinimide esters of stable isotopic variants of propionate. Peptides originating from cat2-2 proteomes were 12C3-propionated, whereas those from Col-0 proteomes were 13C3-propionated by incubation for 1 h at 30°C to a final concentration of 10 mM NHS-label. After quenching remaining N-hydroxysuccinimide esters in 50 mM of glycine for 15 min at 25°C, partial O-propionylation of serine, threonine and tyrosine was reversed by adding hydroxylamine to a final concentration of 50 mM and an incubation for 15 min at 37°C. The samples were acidified to a pH of 3 with acetic acid and equal amounts of peptides were mixed. The COFRADIC technology, relying on diagonal peptide chromatography and the specificity of MSRA and MSRB3 (Jena Bioscience) to specifically isolate peptides carrying in vivo oxidized methionines was applied to the equivalent of 500 μg of protein material as described (33) after which peptides were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. The obtained peptide mixtures were introduced into an LC-MS/MS system; the Ultimate 3000 RSLC nano (Dionex, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) in-line connected to an to an LTQ Orbitrap XL (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany ) for analysis. The peptide mixture was first loaded on a trapping column at a flow rate of 10 μl/min (made in-house, 100 µm internal diameter (I.D.) x 20 mm, 5 µm beads C18 Reprosil-HD, Dr. Maisch). After flushing from the trapping column, the sample was loaded on a reverse-phase column (made in-house, 75 m I.D. x 150 mm, 5 µm beads C18 Reprosil-HD, Dr. Maisch). Peptides were loaded with solvent A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 2% acetonitrile), and were separated with a linear gradient from 2% solvent A’ (0.05% formic acid) to 55% solvent B’ (0.05% formic acid and 80% acetonitrile) at a flow rate of 300 nl/min followed by a wash reaching solvent B’. The mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent mode, automatically switching between MS and MS/MS acquisition for the six most abundant peaks in a given MS spectrum. In the LTQ-Orbitrap XL, full scan MS spectra were acquired in the Orbitrap at a target value of 1E6 with a resolution of 60,000. The six most intense ions were then isolated for fragmentation in the linear ion trap, with a dynamic exclusion of 60 s. Peptides were fragmented after filling the ion trap at a target value of 1E4 ion counts.","dataProcessingProtocol":"From the MS/MS data in each LC run, Mascot Generic Files were created using the Mascot Distiller software (version 2.3.2.0, Matrix Science). While generating these peak lists, grouping of spectra was allowed with a maximum intermediate retention time of 30 s and maximum intermediate scan count of 5 was used where possible. Grouping was done with 0.005 Da precursor tolerance. A peak list was only generated when the MS/MS spectrum contained more than 10 peaks. There was no de-isotoping and the relative signal to noise limit was set at 2. These peak lists were then searched with the Mascot search engine (Matrix Science) using the Mascot Daemon interface (version 2.3, Matrix Science). Spectra were searched against the TAIR database (version 10 containing 27,416 protein-coding genes). Two searches were performed as described (36). In a first search, the quantitation configuration in Mascot was employed where propionate labels were set exclusive to lysines and peptide N-termini. The second search left out the propionate label on peptide N-termini, but considered protein N-terminal acetylation and pyroglutamate formation of glutamine as variable modifications. In both searches methionine oxidation was set as a fixed modification. If a MS/MS spectrum was matched to two different peptides following both searches, the match with the highest score was retained. Mass tolerance on precursor ions was set to ±10 ppm (with Mascot’s C13 option set to 1) and on fragment ions to ±0.5 Da. The peptide charge was set to 1+,2+,3+ and the instrument setting was on ESI-TRAP. The enzyme was set to endoproteinase-LysC, allowing for 1 missed cleavage, and cleavage was also allowed when lysine was followed by proline. Only peptides that were ranked one and scored above the threshold score, set at 99% confidence, were withheld.","otherOmicsLink":null,"numProteins":966,"numPeptides":3902,"numSpectra":96509,"numUniquePeptides":1363,"numIdentifiedSpectra":3902,"references":[{"desc":"Jacques S, Ghesquière B, De Bock PJ, Demol H, Wahni K, Willems P, Messens J, Van Breusegem F, Gevaert K.

One hundred µg of total protein of each sample and 100 µg of a pool containing equal amounts of all samples were diluted with 2 volumes of 0.5 M tetraethylammonium bromide (TEAB) and 1 volume of 18 mΩH2O and 1 µL of 2 % SDS were added to each tube. The samples were reduced by the addition of 2 µL of 50 mM tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) which was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The samples were subsequently alkylated with the addition of 1 µL of 200 mM methyl methanethiosulfonate (MMTS) (Fluka, Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, MO) in gradient grade acetonitrile and incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes. The samples were digested with 4 µg of sequencing grade modified porcine trypsin in 18 mΩH2O water, incubated overnight at 37 °C. TMT labeling of proteins. The digested samples were dried in a SpeedVac to ~25-30 µL and 70 µL of 0.5 M TEAB was added to each tube in preparation for labeling with the TMT. TMT reagents were allowed to equilibrate to room temperature and 42 µL of gradient grade acetonitrile was added to each tube. The TMT reagent was transferred to the appropriate sample tube and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 8 µL of 5 % hydroxylamine (Thermo Scientific, Basel, Switzerland) which was incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature. After TMT labeling, the samples were desalted on PepClean C18 spin columns according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. LC-MS/MS Analysis. The desalted and dried fractions were reconstituted with 15 µL of 0.1 % formic acid in 3 % acetonitrile and analysed on a Q Exactive mass spectrophotometer interfaced with an in-house constructed nano-LC column. For each sample, a 2 µl sample injection was made with an Easy-nLC autosampler, running at 200 nL min1. The peptides were trapped on a precolumn (45 × 0.075 mm i.d.) and separated on a reversed phase column, 190 × 0.075 mm, packed in-house with 3 μm Reprosil-Pur C18-AQ particles (Dr. Maisch, Ammerbuch, Germany) in a pico-frit column (New Objective, MA, USA).

Ions were injected into the LTQ-Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer under a spray voltage of 1.6 kV in positive ion mode. For MS scans, one microscan was performed at 70000 resolution (at m/z 200) and a mass range of m/z 400-1800 operated. MS analysis was performed in a data-dependent mode, with the top 10 most abundant doubly or multiply charged precursor ions in each MS scan selected for fragmentation (MS2) by stepped high energy collision dissociation (HCD). For MS2 scans, one microscan was performed at 7500 resolution (at m/z 400) with a mass range of m/z 110-2000 with stepped collision energies of 25 %, 35 % and 45 %.","dataProcessingProtocol":"MS raw data files for each TMT set were merged for relative quantification and identification using Proteome Discoverer version 1.3. A database search for each set was performed with the Mascot search engine (Matrix Science LTD., London, United Kingdom) using Trichoderma reesei V2 ‘filtered models’ protein database obtained from the Join Genome institute website (http://genome.jgi.doe.gov/Trire2/Trire2.download.html, Department of Energy, Joint genome institute, CA, USA) (Martinez et al., 2008). MS peptide tolerance was 5 ppm and MS/MS tolerance of 100 molecular mass units. Tryptic peptides were accepted with one missed cleavage and variable modifications of methionine oxidation, cysteine methylthiolation and fixed modifications of N-terminal TMT6plex and lysine TMT6plex were selected.  An exclusion list of m/z values was generated from the search results whereby only peptide spectral matches accepted at 1 % False Discovery Rate (FDR) were included, with a mass tolerance of 5 ppm. For the exclusion list, the retention time window was set to 2 minutes. The sample was re-injected into the Q Exactive mass spectrophotometer interfaced with an in-house constructed nano-LC column and run as with the exclusion list using the same parameters as in the first MS analysis. The MS raw files from the first and second MS analysis were combined and searched as described above and a second exclusion list was generated with the same settings as previously described. The TMT sample was re-injected for a third run using the second exclusion list and MS analysis was performed with the same parameters as first and second analysis. The three MS raw data files were combined and searched as described above. TMT quantification. The detected peptide threshold in the software was set to 1 % or 5 % FDR by searching against a reversed database and the result was filtered by selecting proteins with at least one unique peptide per protein. Identified proteins were grouped by sharing the same sequences to minimise redundancy. For TMT quantification, the ratios of the TMT reporter ion intensities in MS/MS spectra ([M+H]+ m/z 126-131) from raw data sets were used to calculate fold changes between samples. Ratios were derived by Proteome Discoverer version 1.3 using the following criteria: fragment ion tolerance as 50 ppm for the most confident centroid peak. TMT reagent purity correction factors were used and missing values were replaced with minimum intensity. Only peptides unique for a given protein were considered for relative quantification, excluding those common to other isoforms or proteins of the same family. The quantification was normalised using the protein median with a minimum protein count of 20. Peptides with co-isolation of greater than 30 % were rejected for quantification purposes. The results were then exported into MS Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) for further data interpretation and statistical analysis.","otherOmicsLink":null,"numProteins":435,"numPeptides":2786,"numSpectra":230236,"numUniquePeptides":783,"numIdentifiedSpectra":2569,"references":[{"desc":"Peciulyte A, Anasontzis GE, Karlström K, Larsson PT, Olsson L.

Samples from Armenia, and Russia were analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry at the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Protein Research at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark using a Q-Exactive mass spectrometer. The LC-MS system consisted of an EASY-nLC™system (Thermo Scientific, Odense, Denmark) connected to the Q-Exactive (Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany) through a nano electrospray ion source. 5 uL of each peptide sample was auto-sampled onto and directly separated in a 15cm analytical column (75 μm inner diameter) in-house packed with 3μm C18 beads (Reprosil-AQ Pur, Dr. Maisch) with a 130 minute linear gradient from 5% to 25% acetonitrile followed by a steeper linear 20 minute gradient from 25% to 40% acetonitrile. Throughout the gradients a fixed concentration of 0.5% acetic acid and a flow rate of 250 nL/min were set. A final washout and column re-equilibration added an additional 20 minutes to each acquisition. The effluent from the HPLC was directly electrosprayed into the mass spectrometer by applying 2.0 kV through a platinum-based liquid-junction. The Q-Exactive was operated in data-dependent mode to automatically switch between full scan MS and MS/MS acquisition.

PNP also has a critical role in host defense responses. Surprisingly, PNP-homologues are also produced by several plant pathogens during host colonization suppressing host defense responses.

Briefly, approximately 1 g of cells was homogenized for 4 sec twice in 10 volumes of ice-cold 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid in acetone using a PowerGen 125 grinder (Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA), vortexed for 2 min and incubated overnight at -20°C. Precipitated and pelleted proteins were washed four times with 80% (v/v) ice-cold acetone with vigorous vortexing and subjected to centrifugation at 3,901 × g using the Allegra® X-22R centrifuge (Beckman Coulter Corp., Brea, CA, USA) for 20 min at 4°C. Pellet was air-dried and proteins were re-suspended in two volumes of urea lysis buffer (7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, phosphatase inhibitor cocktail set II (Calbiochem, Temecula, CA, USA)) with vigorous vortexing for 3 h at room temperature. The samples were cleared by centrifugation at 3,901 × g for 20 min at room temperature and total soluble protein concentration was estimated by Bradford assay (Bradford, 1976) using the Quick Start™ Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and bovine serum albumin as a standard.  Approximately 1 mg of total soluble protein extract was prepared for digestion as previously described (Groen et al., 2013). Protein digestion was stopped by acidification of the mixture to pH 2.0 with trifluoroacetic acid. Peptides were then purified using Sep-Pak Vac tC18 100 mg cartridge (Waters, Milford, MA, USA), as described previously (Groen et al., 2013), and completely dried in a Speed Vac concentrator (Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany).   Peptide labelling using tandem mass tag (TMT) Dried desalted tryptic peptides obtained from the digestion of 1 mg protein were re-suspended in 20% (v/v) acetonitrile and half of the volume was subjected to labelling reaction using tandem mass tag (TMT) sixplexTM isobaric mass tagging kit (Thermo Scientific) performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Each of the labelling reaction mixtures contained the TMT reagents (0.8 mg) dissolved in 41 μl of anhydrous acetonitrile and ~ 0.5 mg of the tryptic peptides in 95 μL of 20% (v/v) acetonitrile. Aliquots of the negative control (samples collected at 0, 10 and 30 min after treating cells with water) tryptic digests were derivatized with sixplex chemical labels 126, 127, and 128, while labels 129 and 130 were added to the tryptic peptides obtained from samples collected at 10 and 30 min after treating cells with AtPNP-A peptide, respectively. After 1 h incubation, reactions were quenched by 15 min incubation with 8 μl of 5% hydroxylamine. Samples were subsequently combined at equal amounts of 0.5 mg peptides in a total reaction volume of 144 μL per sample and stored at -80°C until further use.  Peptide fractionation by OFFGEL fractionator Peptides were fractionated using the 3100 OFFGEL fractionator (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) with a 24-well high-resolution immobilized pH gradient strip. Peptide samples were diluted to a final volume of 1.8 mL with 1.25 × peptide OFFGEL stock solution [50% (v/v) glycerol solution, 10% (v/v) OFFGEL buffer pH range 3-10]. Strips were rehydrated, as recommended by the manufacturer, with 40 μL of 1 × immobilized pH gradient strip rehydration solution per well for 15 min and then 150 μL of sample was pipetted into each well. Electrofocusing was carried out to 64 kVh at 20°C, allowing a maximum of 4500 V and 50 μA per strip. After focusing, fractions were separately collected and the wells rinsed twice with 200 μL of a solution containing 50% (v/v) acetonitrile and 5% (v/v) formic acid for 15 min each time. Rinsing solution collected from each well was combined into the tube containing its corresponding fraction. Fractions were dried in a Speed Vac concentrator (Thermo Scientific), re-suspended in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and purified with Sep-Pak Vac tC18 cartridge (Waters), as previously described (Groen et al., 2013). From each 1 mL fraction of elution per OFFGEL fraction, a volume of 100 μL was subjected to drying in Speed Vac concentrator, suspended in 10 μL of 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and further purified using ZipTipC18 (P-10) pipette tips (EMD Millipore) according to manufacturer’s recommendations. Peptides eluted with solution containing 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in 50% (v/v) acetonitrile were dried in Speed Vac concentrator in preparation for mass spectrometric analysis.

{"accession":"PXD001387","title":"Proteomics of Skin Proteins in Psoriasis","projectDescription":"Herein we demonstrate the efficacy of an unbiased proteomics screening approach for studying protein expression changes in the KC-Tie2 psoriasis mouse model, identifying multiple protein expression changes in the mouse and validating these changes in human psoriasis.  KC-Tie2 mouse skin samples (n=3) were compared with littermate controls (n=3) using gel-based fractionation followed by label-free protein expression analysis. 5482 peptides mapping to 1281 proteins were identified and quantitated: 105 proteins exhibited fold-changes ≥2.0 including: stefin A1 (average fold change of 342.4 and an average P = 0.0082; cystatin A, human orthologue); slc25a5 (average fold change of 46.2 and an average P = 0.0318); serpinb3b (average fold change of 35.6 and an average P = 0.0345; serpinB1, human orthologue); and kallikrein related peptidase 6 (average fold change of 4.7 and an average P = 0.2474; KLK6).   We independently confirmed mouse gene expression-based increases of selected genes including serpinb3b (17.4-fold, P < 0.0001), KLK6 (9.0-fold, P = 0.002), stefin A1 (7.3-fold; P < 0.001) and slc25A5 (1.5-fold; P = 0.05) using qRT-PCR on a second cohort of animals (n=8). Parallel LC/MS/MS analyses on these same samples verified protein-level increases of 1.3-fold (slc25a5; P < 0.05), 29,000-fold (stefinA1; P < 0.01), 322-fold (KLK6; P < 0.0001) between KC-Tie2 and control mice. To underscore the utility and translatability of our combined approach, we analyzed gene and protein expression levels in psoriasis patient skin and primary keratinocytes vs. healthy controls. Increases in gene expression for slc25a5 (1.8-fold), cystatin A (3.0-fold), KLK6 (5.8-fold) and serpinB1 (76-fold; all P < 0.05) were observed between healthy controls and involved lesional psoriasis skin and primary psoriasis keratinocytes.  Moreover slc25a5, cystatin A, KLK6 and serpinB1 protein were all increased in lesional psoriasis skin compared to normal skin. These results highlight the usefulness of preclinical disease models using readily-available mouse skin and demonstrate the utility of proteomic approaches for identifying novel peptides/proteins that are differentially regulated in psoriasis that could serve as sources of auto-antigens or provide novel therapeutic targets for the development of new anti-psoriatic treatments.","publicationDate":"2014-10-30","submissionType":"COMPLETE","numAssays":6,"species":["Mus musculus (Mouse)"],"tissues":["skin"],"ptmNames":["Carbamidomethyl","Oxidation"],"instrumentNames":["LTQ Orbitrap Velos"],"projectTags":["Biological","Biomedical"],"doi":"10.6019/PXD001387","submitter":{"title":"Ms","firstName":"Kathleen","lastName":"Lundberg","email":"kathleen.lundberg@case.edu","affiliation":"Case Western Reserve University"},"labHeads":[{"title":"Dr","firstName":"Mark R.","lastName":"Chance","email":"mark.chance@case.edu","affiliation":"Mark R.

Sample preparation for gel-based label-free expression discovery. Tissue protein samples which had been isolated and prepared as previously described (7) were thawed and total protein concentrations were determined using a Bio-Rad Protein Assay as described by the manufacturer. Samples were reduced for 15 minutes at 80°C using DTT with a final concentration of 10 mM.  The samples were then cooled to room temperature and alkylated with iodacetamide for 30 minutes with a final concentration of 25 mM.  Figure 1 summarizes the gel-based workflow used.  Briefly, 30 µg of each sample were loaded per well of a 1D- SDS-PAGE gel (4-20% Tris-HCl). The gel was stained using Bio-Rad Biosafe Coomassie (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) and then cut into 8 distinct regions based on apparent protein molecular weight (Supplemental Figure 1). Isolated gel regions were washed using 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate (ABC; Fisher Scientific, Fairlawn, NJ) followed by 50% acetonitrile (ACN; Burdick and Jackson, Morristown, NJ) twice.  Then the gel regions were crushed and proteolytic digestion was performed using bovine trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) with a final enzyme concentration of 100 ng for 18 hours at 37°C.

RNA was isolated from the second, independent group of KC-Tie2 and control littermates (n=8 each) and qRT-PCR performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions and as described previously (Johnston et al., 2013) using the following primer-probe sets Rab18 (Mm00441057_m1), Serpinb3b (Mm03032256_uH), Stefin A1 (Mm01973758_gH), KLK6 (Mm00478322_m1) and Slc25a5 ADP/ATP translocase 2 (Mm00846873_g1; Applied Biosystems, Grand Island, NY).  Sample preparation for solution-based label-free expression verification.  Skin adjacent to that used for RNA isolation and analyses described above was collected and used to perform a second solution-based label free expression assay.  KC-Tie2 and control mouse skin (n=4 each) was placed into ice-cold 25 mM Tris pH 8.5 containing protease cocktail inhibitor (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and thoroughly rinsed to remove any remaining blood from the tissue.  Each sample was rinsed with ice-cold 25 mM Tris pH 8.5 containing a cocktail of protease inhibitors.  Figure 1 highlights the solution-based workflow.  The tissue was transferred to a cryo bag (Covaris, Woburn, MA), capped and frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to being pulverized.  Once pulverized, each sample was again frozen in liquid nitrogen and subjected to an additional round of pulverization.  From each sample approximately 10 mg was transferred to a 1.5 mL tube and 300 µL of 3% SDS was added.  Pulverized tissue was then incubated on ice for 30 minutes. Aliquots were sonicated at 50% amplitude followed by vortexing; this cycle was repeated 4 times with samples sitting on ice between each round.  SDS detergent removal and reduction and alkylation was performed using the Filter Assisted Sample Preparation method (FASP) (8).  Total protein concentration was determined using a modified Bradford assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories), and 10 μg of protein was digested as previously described (9).","dataProcessingProtocol":"Liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry for discovery and verification. LC/MS/MS was performed using a Waters ultra high-pressure liquid chromatography NanoAcquity (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA) an LTQ Orbitrap Velos and an Orbitrap Elite (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA).  The order of sample injections was randomized across all samples. The instrument was mass calibrated immediately before the analysis using the instrument protocol. Mobile phase A (aqueous) contained 0.1% formic acid in 5% ACN and mobile phase B (organic) contained 0.1% formic acid in 85% ACN.   Samples were trapped and desalted on-line in mobile phase A at10 µL/min for 10 minutes using a Waters UPLC PST C18 nanoACQUITY 300 (75 µm x 25 cm) reversed phase column with 5% mobile phase B.  Gel based discovery separation was obtained by employing a gradient of 6% to 28% mobile B at 0.300 µL/min over 150 minutes. The column was washed at 99% mobile phase B for 10 minutes, followed by a re-equilibration at 100% A for 15 minutes.  Positive mode electrospray was conducted using a nanospray source and the mass spectrometer was operated at a resolution of 60,000.  Quantitative and qualitative data were acquired using alternating full MS scan and MS/MS scans in normal mode.  Survey data were acquired from m/z of 400 to 1600 and up to 20 precursors based on intensity were interrogated by MS/MS per switch.  Two micro scans were acquired for every precursor interrogated and MS/MS was acquired as centroid data.  All mass spectrometry analytical parameters for the verification samples were the same as the discovery samples with exception of the LC/MS/MS analytical run time which was extended to 240 minutes. For the gel based discovery study, excised gel regions for each animal were processed and analyzed as a separate LC/MS/MS for total of 48 individual LC/MS/MS runs.  One LC/MS/MS run was acquired for each animal in the verification set for a total of 8 LC/MS/MS runs.  The discovery set was processed via Rosetta Elucidator (Rosetta Biosoftware, Seattle, WA) (Version 3.3.01 SP4 25).  The MS/MS peak lists were subsequently searched by Mascot (version 2.2.0, IPI_mouse_06_2010) (Matrix Science, London, UK).  The database used was mouse International Protein Index (IPI) (56957 sequences).  Search settings were as follows: trypsin enzyme specificity; mass accuracy window for precursor ion, 10 ppm; mass accuracy window for fragment ions, 0.8Da; variable modifications including carbamidomethlylation of cysteins, 1 missed cleavage and oxidation of methoinine. The false discovery rate for these settings was calculated to be 1.13% for the discovery set.  Automated differential quantification of peptides was performed with Rosetta Elucidator as previously described (10, 11).  The processing workflow that was used for differential quantification in the discovery set is shown in Supplemental Figure 2.  LC/MS/MS raw data was imported and for each MS spectrum profile of each LC/MS/MS run, chromatographic peaks and monoisotopic masses were extracted and aligned.  Specifically, chromatographic peaks were first aligned by retention time and monoisotopic mass across each sample by gel region.  Next, intensities of monoisotopic masses found in multiple gel regions (within a RT tolerance) of a sample were summed.  Peaklists with the monoisotopic mass and corresponding MS/MS data were then generated for each sample and searched using Mascot.  Resultant peptide identifications were imported into Elucidator and monoisotopic masses annotated with peptide identifications.  Statistical analysis of the dataset was performed using a Student’s t-test and peptides from the same protein were summed together to provide fold changes for each protein identified. The verification dataset was searched using the same database and search engine parameters as described above with a false discovery rate of 3.7% for the verification set.  Peak areas from peptides of targets that were identified via the Mascot database search were subsequently determined by manual extraction and integration using the Qual browser in the Xcalibur software (version 2.2) (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA).","otherOmicsLink":null,"numProteins":16396,"numPeptides":752172,"numSpectra":718524,"numUniquePeptides":97721,"numIdentifiedSpectra":269352,"references":[]}

For serum deprivation experiments cells were plated in 75T flask, washed 3 times with serum-free media (DMEM (D5030, Sigma) supplemented with 0.3 g/L glucose, 0.584 g/L L-glutamine and 3.7 g/L sodium bicarbonate) and then were grown in serum-free media for 24 h. Fractionation of culture medium Serum free media were collected and centrifuged at 2000g for 20 min to remove apoptotic bodies. Next microvesicles and exosomes were pelleted by centrifugation at 120000g for 70 min. The final supernatant was concentrated using Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filter Devices (Millipore) to a volume of 0.5 ml. The pellet (microvesicles and exosomes) were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Sodium Phosphate dibasic, 2 mM Potassium Phosphate monobasic at (pH of 7.4)), centrifugated at 120000g for 70 min and resuspended in 0.5 ml PBS. In-solution trypsin digestion of different culture medium fractions To the culture medium fractions (pellet and supernatant), denaturing buffer (8M Urea, 2M Thiourea, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)) was added in the ratio 1:3 and the samples were incubated at 24oC for a 30 min.

{"accession":"PXD001415","title":"Comprehensive Assessment of Proteins Regulated by Dexamethasone Reveals Novel Effects in Primary Human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells - nuclear proteins of untreated cells","projectDescription":"Inflammation is a physiological process involved in many diseases. Monitoring proteins involved in regulatory effects may help to improve our understanding of inflammation. We have analyzed proteome alterations induced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) upon inflammatory activation in great detail using high resolution mass spectrometry. Moreover, the activated cells were treated with dexamethasone to investigate their response to this antiphlogistic drug. From a total of 6886 identified proteins, 469 proteins were significantly regulated upon inflammatory activation. Most of these proteins were counter-regulated by dexamethasone, with some exceptions concerning members of the interferon-induced protein family. To confirm some of these results, we performed targeted MRM analyses of selected peptides. The inflammation-induced up-regulation of proteins such as IL-1beta, IL-6, CXCL2 and GROα was confirmed, however with strong quantitative inter-individual differences.

For digestion of secreted proteins a variation of the FASP protocol was used. 3kD MWCO filters (Pall Austria Filter GmbH) were rinsed with LC-MS grade water (Millipore GesmbH). 20µg of each protein sample was concentrated onto the pre-washed filter by centrifugation at 15000g for 15min to get a final sample volume of 10-20µl. For reduction, 200µl of DTT solution (5mg/ml dissolved in 8M guanidinium hydrochloride in 50mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer (ABC buffer), pH 8) were added and incubation was performed at 56°C for 30min.

Following 4h cultivation, cells were further grown for 3h in serum-free medium for secretome analysis and afterwards harvested. Supernatants were sterile-filtered through a 0.2µm filter and precipitated overnight with ice-cold ethanol at -20°C for isolation of secreted proteins. After precipitation, samples were dissolved in sample buffer (7.5 M urea, 1.5 M thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 0.05% SDS, 100 mM DDT) and the protein concentrations were determined by means of Bradford assay (Bio-Rad-Laboratories, Germany). For digestion of secreted proteins a variation of the FASP protocol was used. 3kD MWCO filters (Pall Austria Filter GmbH) were rinsed with LC-MS grade water (Millipore GesmbH). 20µg of each protein sample was concentrated onto the pre-washed filter by centrifugation at 15000g for 15min to get a final sample volume of 10-20µl. For reduction, 200µl of DTT solution (5mg/ml dissolved in 8M guanidinium hydrochloride in 50mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer (ABC buffer), pH 8) were added and incubation was performed at 56°C for 30min. After centrifugation at 14000g for 10min, a washing step with ABC buffer was performed. For alkylation, 200µl of IAA solution (10mg/ml in 8M guanidinium hydrochloride in 50mM ABC buffer) were added and incubation was performed in the dark for 45min. After centrifugation at 14000g for 10min, proteins on top of the filter were washed with ABC buffer. Afterwards, filters (with a maximum of 50µl sample volume) were placed in a new Eppendorf tube and 100µl ABC buffer as well as 10µl trypsin solution (0.1µg/µl) were added and incubation was performed at 37°C for 18h. After trypsin digestion, peptide samples were cleaned up with C-18 spin columns (Pierce, Thermo Scientific). Therefore, columns were pre-washed two times with 500µl ACN and equilibrated with 200µl 5% ACN, 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) by centrifugation at 1500g for 1min. The peptide samples were acidified to a final concentration of 1% TFA and transferred from the MWCO filters to spin columns. After centrifugation at 1500g for 1min, the flow-through was re-loaded on the column to maximize peptide binding and again centrifuged. After a washing step with 5% ACN, 0.5% TFA, the peptides were eluted two times with 40µl 50% ACN, 0.1% TFA and once with 40µl 80% ACN, 0.1% TFA into a new Eppendorf tube.

While most consequences of dexamethasone were found compatible with the expected way of action, some unexpected but significant observations may relate with adverse effects.","publicationDate":"2014-11-04","submissionType":"COMPLETE","numAssays":3,"species":["Homo sapiens (Human)"],"tissues":["blood"],"ptmNames":["Carbamidomethyl","Acetyl","Oxidation"],"instrumentNames":["Q Exactive"],"projectTags":["Biomedical"],"doi":"10.6019/PXD001423","submitter":{"title":"Professor","firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Gerner","email":"christopher.gerner@univie.ac.at","affiliation":"University of Vienna"},"labHeads":[{"title":"Dr","firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Gerner","email":"christopher.gerner@univie.ac.at","affiliation":"University of Vienna, Faculty of Chemistry, Department of Analytical Chemistry"}],"submissionDate":"2014-10-20","reanalysis":null,"experimentTypes":["Shotgun proteomics"],"quantificationMethods":[],"keywords":"Adverse drug effects, cell biology, drug effects, inflammatory response, mass spectrometry, PBMCs, proteomics, secretome","sampleProcessingProtocol":"PBMCs were isolated from three different healthy volunteers with written consent of each donor and approval of the Ethics Committee of the Medical University of Vienna. 50ml of non-coagulated whole blood were collected in 6ml CPDA tubes (Greiner Bio-One GmbH, Austria) and immediately processed by diluting it 1:2 with RPMI1640 medium (Gibco, Life Technologies, Austria) supplemented with 100U/ml penicillin and 100µg/ml streptomycin (ATCC, LGC Standards GmbH, Germany). The diluted blood suspension was carefully overlaid on Ficoll Paque (GE Healthcare, Bio-Sciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden) and centrifuged at 500g for 20min at 24°C. The interphase was then collected and washed with PBS. The washed cell pellet was resuspendend in diluted autologous plasma. For activation, 1µg/ml LPS (Sigma-Aldrich) and 5µg/ml PHA (Sigma-Aldrich) were added to the cells and incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2. For dexamethasone treatment, 100ng/ml dexamethasone (Sigma-Aldrich) was added after 1h activation. Following 4h cultivation, cells were further grown for 3h in serum-free medium for secretome analysis and afterwards harvested. Supernatants were sterile-filtered through a 0.2µm filter and precipitated overnight with ice-cold ethanol at -20°C for isolation of secreted proteins. After precipitation, samples were dissolved in sample buffer (7.5 M urea, 1.5 M thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 0.05% SDS, 100 mM DDT) and the protein concentrations were determined by means of Bradford assay (Bio-Rad-Laboratories, Germany). For digestion of secreted proteins a variation of the FASP protocol was used. 3kD MWCO filters (Pall Austria Filter GmbH) were rinsed with LC-MS grade water (Millipore GesmbH). 20µg of each protein sample was concentrated onto the pre-washed filter by centrifugation at 15000g for 15min to get a final sample volume of 10-20µl. For reduction, 200µl of DTT solution (5mg/ml dissolved in 8M guanidinium hydrochloride in 50mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer (ABC buffer), pH 8) were added and incubation was performed at 56°C for 30min. After centrifugation at 14000g for 10min, a washing step with ABC buffer was performed. For alkylation, 200µl of IAA solution (10mg/ml in 8M guanidinium hydrochloride in 50mM ABC buffer) were added and incubation was performed in the dark for 45min. After centrifugation at 14000g for 10min, proteins on top of the filter were washed with ABC buffer. Afterwards, filters (with a maximum of 50µl sample volume) were placed in a new Eppendorf tube and 100µl ABC buffer as well as 10µl trypsin solution (0.1µg/µl) were added and incubation was performed at 37°C for 18h. After trypsin digestion, peptide samples were cleaned up with C-18 spin columns (Pierce, Thermo Scientific). Therefore, columns were pre-washed two times with 500µl ACN and equilibrated with 200µl 5% ACN, 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) by centrifugation at 1500g for 1min. The peptide samples were acidified to a final concentration of 1% TFA and transferred from the MWCO filters to spin columns. After centrifugation at 1500g for 1min, the flow-through was re-loaded on the column to maximize peptide binding and again centrifuged. After a washing step with 5% ACN, 0.5% TFA, the peptides were eluted two times with 40µl 50% ACN, 0.1% TFA and once with 40µl 80% ACN, 0.1% TFA into a new Eppendorf tube. Finally the digested peptide samples in the flow-through were dried and stored at -20°C until further MS analyses. For LC-MS/MS analyses dried samples were reconstituted in 5µl 30% formic acid (FA) and diluted with 40µl mobile phase A (98% H2O, 2% ACN, 0.1% FA). 10µl of this solution were then injected into the Dionex Ultimate 3000 nano LC-system coupled to a QExactive orbitrap mass spectrometer equipped with a nanospray ion source (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Austria). All samples were analyzed in duplicates. As a pre-concentration step, peptides were loaded on a 2cm x75µm C18 Pepmap100 pre-column (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Austria) at a flow rate of 10µl/min using mobile phase A. Elution from the pre-column to a 50cm x75µm Pepmap100 analytical column (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Austria) and subsequent separation was achieved at a flow rate of 300nl/min using a gradient of 8% to 40% mobile phase B (80% ACN, 2% H2O, 0.1% FA) over 95min.

The potential benefits of tissue-specific scaffolds consisting of naturally-derived extracellular matrix (ECM) have been demonstrated using a wide variety of animal and human tissue sources. However, so far, testis scaffolds have never been considered for constructive remodelling purposes. We have therefore developed a protocol for the preparation of cell-free extracellular matrix and characterized the material extensively using a combination of proteomics, immunohistochemsitry, and cell population assays. To prepare cell-free matrix, human cadaveric testicular tissue was exposed for 24 h or 48 h to 1% Triton X-100 and/or 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The extent of decellularization was evaluated by histology. Confirmation of cell removal in DTM was done by a DNA quantification technique. The protein composition was analysed by LC-MS/MS. The retention of testicular tissue-specific characteristics was evaluated by immunohistochemistry, Alcian blue staining and scanning electron microscopy. Soluble toxicity and testicular cell attachment was assessed to check the cytocompatibility of DTM scaffolds.  Histological analysis showed that DTM could be obtained by mechanical agitation in 1% SDS for 24 h. The resulting DTM was found to be clear of cells while retaining the typical three-dimensional structure. Proteomics analysis revelaed the presence of  the major components of the native tissue scaffold, including collagen type I and IV, fibronectin, laminin and glycosaminoglycans. In addition, numerous additional ECM proteins in DTM were detected, indicating its complex nature.

{"accession":"PXD001528","title":"Paraquat Exposure and Sod2 Knockdown have Dissimilar Impacts on the Drosophila melanogaster Carbonylated Protein Proteome","projectDescription":"Exposure to Paraquat and RNA interference knockdown of mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (Sod2) are known to result in significant lifespan reduction, locomotor dysfunction, and mitochondrial degeneration in Drosophila melanogaster. Both perturbations increase the flux of superoxide, a progenitor reactive oxygen species, but the molecular underpinnings of the resulting phenotypes are poorly understood. Improved understanding of such processes could lead to advances in the treatment of numerous age-related disorders. Superoxide toxicity can act through protein carbonylation. Analysis of carbonylated proteins is attractive since reactive carbonyl groups are not present in the twenty canonical amino acids and are amenable to labeling and enrichment strategies. Here, carbonylated proteins were labeled with biotin hydrazide and enriched on streptavidin-coated beads. On-bead digestion was used to release carbonylated protein peptides, with relative abundance ratios versus controls obtained using the iTRAQ mass spectrometry-based proteomics approach. While Paraquat exposure and Sod2 knockdown have similar phenotypes, differences in protein carbonylation were anticipated because Paraquat exposure was expected to increase the concentration of superoxide throughout the cell while Sod2 knockdown was only expected to raise the concentration of superoxide in the mitochondrial matrix. Paraquat exposure resulted in widespread increases in carbonylated protein relative abundance: the median Paraquat-exposed to control carbonylated protein relative abundance ratio was 1.53. For Sod2 knockdown, in contrast, the median carbonylated protein relative abundance ratios were 1.13 versus the RNA interference driver control and 1.05 versus the RNA interference transgene control. However, some proteins did show large increases in carbonylated protein relative abundance on Sod2 knockdown, most notably cytochrome c oxidase subunit Vb, possibly providing some indication of the molecular basis of the Sod2-knockdown phenotype.","publicationDate":"2014-11-26","submissionType":"COMPLETE","numAssays":21,"species":["Drosophila melanogaster (Fruit fly)"],"tissues":["whole body"],"ptmNames":["iodoacetamide derivatized residue","deaminated residue","dehydrated residue","iTRAQ4plex-116 reporter+balance reagent acylated residue","monohydroxylated residue"],"instrumentNames":["LTQ Orbitrap Velos"],"projectTags":["Biological"],"doi":"10.6019/PXD001528","submitter":{"title":"Dr","firstName":"David","lastName":"Simpson","email":"dsimpson3@vcu.edu","affiliation":"Virginia Commonwealth University, Department of Chemistry"},"labHeads":[{"title":"Dr","firstName":"Scott","lastName":"Gronert","email":"sgronert@vcu.edu","affiliation":"Virginia Commonwealth University"}],"submissionDate":"2014-11-24","reanalysis":null,"experimentTypes":["Shotgun proteomics"],"quantificationMethods":["iTRAQ"],"keywords":"Drosophila melanogaster, protein carbonylation, Orbitrap, HCD, iTRAQ","sampleProcessingProtocol":"Flies were aged (Sod2-knockdown studies) or exposed to Paraquat until circa 50% were dead. Age-matched populations of control flies were handled in parallel. The Drosophila melanogaster strain used for the Paraquat-exposure study was w1118, while RNA interference Sod2 knockdown was achieved using the da-Gal4 driver to drive ubiquitous expression of the UAS-Sod2-IR24 transgene; two controls were used for the Sod2-knockdown study, one containing the driver alone and one containing the transgene alone. Flies, in batches of circa 500, were sacrificed by freezing overnight at -20°C and then homogenized using 15 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer in 5 mL ice-cold buffer (100 mM sucrose, 100 mM KCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM KH2PO4, 0.1 mM EGTA, adjusted to pH 7.3) containing the protease inhibitors aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A at 500 ng/mL. Large debris was then removed by centrifugation at 300 × g for 20 min at 4°C. Supernatants were stored at -20°C until further processing could be performed. Biotinylation of reactive protein carbonyls was begun by adding biotin hydrazide to the homogenates to 5 mM and then incubating for 60 min at room temperature with gentle agitation. Sodium dodecyl sulfate was then added to 2% (w/v) to disrupt membranes and dissolve released proteins before a second addition of biotin hydrazide to 5 mM was performed, which was followed by 120-min incubation at room temperature with gentle agitation. The biotin label was fixed by adding sodium cyanoborohydride to 15 mM and incubating at 4°C for 60 min. PD midiTrap G-25 gel filtration cartridges (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) were used to separate labeled proteins from reagents and then a bicinchoninic acid protein concentration assay (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL, USA) was performed. Equal amounts of total protein were added to streptavidin UltraLink resin (Pierce Biotechnology), which had previously be washed with phosphate buffered saline, and incubated at room temperature overnight with slow rotation. Unbound proteins were removed by washing the resin three times with phosphate buffered saline followed by once with 8 M urea and 10 mM dithiothreitol in phosphate buffered saline. Protein denaturation and reduction was allowed to proceed at 37°C for 60 min in 8 M urea and 10 mM dithiothreitol in phosphate buffered saline. Cysteines were capped by adding iodoacetamide to 55 mM and incubating for 60 min at room temperature in the dark. Excess reagents were removed from the beads prior to digestion by washing with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (aq). Digestion with trypsin was allowed to proceed overnight at 37°C and was terminated by acidification with 10% TFA (aq). Carbonylated protein peptides were recovered by extensive washing of the beads with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (aq). Recovered peptide solutions were then evaporated to dryness in a centrifugal evaporator before being labeled with the iTRAQ reagents as recommended by the manufacturer. To enable non-specific binding to the streptavidin-coated beads to be assessed, additional aliquots of Paraquat-exposed and control flies were processed with and without biotin hydrazide. After iTRAQ labeling, samples were combined, evaporated to dryness in a centrifugal evaporator, and then resuspended with 20 µL 0.1% formic acid (aq). Each replicate LC-MS/MS run consumed 2 µL of this iTRAQ-labeled peptide solution. LC-MS/MS data was recorded using a Thermo LTQ Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer interfaced with a Waters nanoACQUITY LC system, using HCD for both peptide identification and to obtain reporter ions. The LC gradient was composed of 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (B) versus 0.1% formic acid in water (A). Beginning with an equilibration mobile phase of 1% B, the linear gradient initially ran to 15% B over 25 min, then to 25% B over 35 min, then to 35% B over 40 min, and finally to 85% B over 20 min. The flow rate was 400 nL/min.","dataProcessingProtocol":"Peptides were identified from recorded tandem mass spectra using the version of X!

PeptideProphet, a component of the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline software package, was used to filter identifications proposed by X! Tandem, with the minimum score for accepted peptide-spectrum matches being 0.9. Raw ratios were corrected using those observed for trypsin auto-digestion peptides, since the digestion enzyme was added late in the procedure.

The concentration of L-Arginine.HCl was reduced to 16.8 mg/L (8.4% of the normal concentration in RPMI) to prevent metabolic conversion of arginine to proline. Cells were cultured at 37°C and in 5% CO2 for at least six population doublings to ensure complete incorporation of the labelled arginine. Upon completion, aliquots of 107 SILAC-labelled cells were washed three times with PBS and cell pellets were frozen at -80˚C until further use. SILAC-labelled cells were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mM 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES), 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA and 1 mM DTT by three rounds of freeze-thawing. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation for 15 min at 16,000 g, followed by acidification to pH 5.5 using 1 M HCl. For cathepsin treatment, we used a differential sample mixing strategy to allow highly automated, software-based quantification and annotation of protein processing events, as reported previously. Here, the control sample, made from three parts of light-labelled cell lysate, was incubated with 10 µM E-64, whereas the treated sample, made from one part light-labelled and one part heavy-labelled cell lysate, was incubated with 200 nM recombinant cathepsin L, K or S, for 15 min at 37°C. After incubation, the control and cathepsin-treated samples were mixed, 4 M guanidinium hydrochloride was added and the pH was raised to 7.4 to proceed with COFRADIC isolation of N-terminal peptides. The N-terminal COFRADIC protocol was performed as described before. Briefly, proteins were reduced and alkylated using 15 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) and 30 mM iodoacetamide. After desalting the protein mixtures on NAP-10 columns in 2 M guanidinium hydrochloride and 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 8, free amino groups were acetylated by incubation with 20 mM of an N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester of trideutero-acetate (made in-house) for 1 h at 30°C followed by addition of 10 mM glycine to quench residual NHS esters and 120 mM hydroxylamine to reverse potential O-acetylation and incubation for 20 min at room temperature. The protein samples were again desalted on NAP-10 columns in 20 mM ammonium bicarbonate, boiled for 5 min, put on ice for 5 min and digested overnight with sequencing-grade trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) (enzyme/substrate of 1/100, w/w) at 37°C. The resulting peptide mixtures were incubated with 1,250 mU Q-cyclase and 625 mU activated pGAPase to drive the formation of N-terminal pyroglutamate to completion and proteolytically remove this residue, respectively. N-terminal peptides were then pre-enriched by strong cation exchange (SCX) chromatography on disposable SCX cartridges (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) in a buffer containing 50% acetonitrile in 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 3.0. N-terminal peptides, which were not retained on the SCX resin under these conditions, were collected in the run-through fraction, concentrated by vacuum drying and re-suspended in 10 mM ammonium acetate pH 5.5 in 2% acetonitrile. Methionine residues were oxidized by incubating the peptides with 0.5% H2O2 for 30 min at 30°C, followed by immediate injection of the samples on a capillary RP-HPLC column (Zorbax 300SB-C18, 2.1 mm internal diameter, 150 mm length, Agilent Technologies) for the first COFRADIC separation. Peptides were separated by a linear gradient of acetonitrile (from 2% to 70% in 100 min) and peptides that eluted between 20 and 80 min were collected in 15 primary COFRADIC fractions of 4 min each. Each primary fraction was incubated four times with 15 nmol 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) and each fraction was re-separated by RP-HPLC under the same conditions as during the primary separation. N-terminal peptides, which cannot get modified by TNBS, eluted from the column during the same time interval and were collected in 16 fractions of 0.5 min. Internal and C-terminal peptides, which were modified by TNBS, underwent a hydrophobic shift and were not collected. Secondary fractions with 12 min difference in retention time were pooled to a total of 48 samples for LC-MS/MS analysis.","dataProcessingProtocol":"Samples were analyzed by LC-MS/MS on a linear trap quadrupole (LTQ) Orbitrap Velos or a LTQ Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and peak list files were generated from the peptide fragmentation spectra as described before.

Briefly, semiArgC/P was used as enzyme setting with one missed cleavage allowed. Methionine oxidation, trideuteron-acetylation of lysine and alkylation of cysteine were set as fixed modifications, while variable modifications included acetylation and trideutero-acetylation of N-termini and pyroglutamate formation of N-terminal glutamine residues. Mass tolerance of precursor and fragment ions was set to 10 ppm and 0.5 Da, respectively. To allow identification of peptides from both light and heavy labelled samples, a quantitation method with two different components was made, defining 12C6 Arg and 13C6 Arg as exclusive modifications at any position. Only peptides that were ranked first and scored above the threshold score set at 99% confidence were withheld. The FDR was calculated for every search as described previously and was always found to be lower than 0.78%. Potential false positive peptide identifications were selected and automatically removed by the Peptizer software application exactly as described before. Only peptides that fulfilled the following three conditions were considered as neo-N-terminal peptides reporting true cathepsin cleavage sites: (1) the start position of the peptide in the protein sequence is >2, (2) the N-terminal alpha amino group of the peptide is modified by trideutero-acetylation and (3) the light/heavy (L/H) ratio is > 2 (L/H ratios of neo-N-terminal peptides are distributed around 1, determination of the ratio cut-off value is based on the boundary of a one-sided 99% quantile of the ratio distribution) as described before [29].

Nanoflow liquid chromatography coupled with high resolution tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS/MS) has emerged as the most suitable technology for global histone modification analysis due to the high sensitivity and the high mass accuracy that provide confident identification. However, the histone nanoLC-MS/MS data analysis is even more challenging due to the large number and variety of isobaric histone peptides, and the high dynamic range of histone peptide abundances. Here, we introduce EpiProfile, a software tool that discriminates isobaric histone peptides using the distinguishing fragment ions in their tandem mass spectra and extracts the chromatographic area under the curve using previous knowledge about peptide retention time. The accuracy of EpiProfile was evaluated by analysis of mixtures containing different ratios of synthetic histone peptides. In addition to label-free quantification of histone peptides, EpiProfile is flexible, and can quantify different types of isotopically labeled histone peptides. EpiProfile is much more convenient when compared to manual quantification, filling the need of an automatic and freely available tool to quantify labeled and non-labeled modified histone peptides. In summary, EpiProfile is a valuable nanoLC-MS/MS based quantification tool for histone modifications, which can also be adapted to analyze non-histone protein samples.","publicationDate":"2015-03-27","submissionType":"COMPLETE","numAssays":1,"species":["Homo sapiens (Human)"],"tissues":["HeLa cell"],"ptmNames":["formylated residue","propanoylated residue","butanoylated residue","phosphorylated residue","acetylated residue"],"instrumentNames":["LTQ Orbitrap Velos"],"projectTags":["Biological"],"doi":"10.6019/PXD001541","submitter":{"title":"Dr","firstName":"Zuo-Fei","lastName":"Yuan","email":"zuoyuan@mail.med.upenn.edu","affiliation":"UPenn"},"labHeads":[{"title":"Dr","firstName":"Benjamin A.","lastName":"Garcia","email":"bgarci@mail.med.upenn.edu","affiliation":"Epigenetics Program, Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania"}],"submissionDate":"2014-11-26","reanalysis":null,"experimentTypes":["Shotgun proteomics"],"quantificationMethods":["SILAC"],"keywords":"histone, post-translational modification, proteomics, quantification, retention time, isobaric peptide","sampleProcessingProtocol":"Endogenous histones from HeLa cells HeLa Cell Culture - As previously described (1), HeLa cells were cultured in suspension with Minimum Essential Medium Eagle (MEM) Joklik modification for Suspension Cultures with 10% Newborn Calf Serum (Thermo Scientific SH30118.03), 1% Glutamax (Gibco, 35050-079), and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin (Gibco, 15140-122).

{"accession":"PXD001574","title":"Phospho-iTRAQ","projectDescription":"One of the most extensively studied protein modifications is phosphorylation, a reversible posttranslational modification (PTM) with a central role in a broad range of cellular processes such as cell metabolism, homeostasis, transcription and apoptosis. Due to their transient character, phosphorylations initiate and propagate signal transduction pathways, making these fundamental to inter- and intracellular communication. Detection of phosphorylation is nevertheless challenging considering the dynamic regulation, low stoichiometry and heterogeneous character of the phosphosites. Numerous dedicated phosphoproteomics workflows have therefore been developed in order to unravel phosphorylation networks and the activity of their modulating enzymes. In these workflows, phosphopeptides are typically enriched prior to mass spectrometry analysis to remove the strong background interference caused by the bulk of non-phosphorylated peptides (3). Apart from requiring thorough optimization and a corresponding high level of expertise of the analyst however, enrichment is also responsible for sample loss and limited quantitation accuracy (4). Subsequent mass spectrometry analysis is furthermore confounded by low ionization efficiency and inferior fragmentation of phosphopeptides. Conventional MS/MS analysis with collision-induced dissociation predominantly results in the neutral loss of the phosphate group, leading to poor sequence coverage due to reduced backbone fragmentation. An additional stage of fragmentation in MS3 or the use of alternative fragmentation technologies such as higher energy C-trap dissociation or electron transfer dissociation can partially facilitate the detection and identification of phosphopeptides (5, 6).  In order to draw accurate biological conclusions it is mandatory to obtain quantitative information on the phospho-modifications. Most quantitative approaches aim to elucidate the relative phosphorylation changes between samples, employing direct label-free comparisons of phospho-enriched fractions, or metabolic or chemical labeling methods such as SILAC, iTRAQ or tandem mass tag (TMT) (4, 6, 7). Such methods however, forego the investigation of phosphorylation stoichiometry, also known as occupancy, since such analysis requires the simultaneous monitoring of the unphosphorylated counterpart (8).  One interesting labeling strategy that is specifically designed to quantify occupancy circumvents the common difficulties of standard phosphopeptide detection by focusing on the non-phosphorylated counterparts of the phosphopeptides (11). Herein, a peptide sample is briefly split in two identical parts which are differentially labeled, preceding a phosphatase treatment of one part and mock-treatment of the other. Immediately afterwards the two parts are recombined for the subsequent LC-MS/MS analysis. Dephosphorylation of a phosphopeptide will  induce a 79.979 mass shift resulting in a skewed label ratio in the unphosphorylated peptide’s reporter region which now specifies the phosphorylation stoichiometry (12). Although the principle has been described previously (12-19), only one phosphatase-based workflow was adapted specifically for the large-scale study of a complete lysate whereby known phosphopeptides present in a database were quantified by isotopic labels (20). Here we extend for the first time the isobaric tag equivalent of this approach for the large-scale quantitative phospho-analysis of complex mixtures. The technique was validated on three different instrument platforms on epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated HeLa cells (23). We discuss a novel data analysis approach for the discovery of high stoichiometry phosphopeptides in complex peptide mixtures and present a way to interpret the sizable dataset without matching the peptide identifications to a phospho-database. Because all peptides and not only the phosphorylated fraction of the proteome is measured in this approach, instruments with high-speed acquisition capabilities and adequate resolution for accurate reporter quantitation are indispensable. Still, because of the minimal technical variation that is introduced throughout the workflow (as for Wu et.al. (20)), implementation of extensive fractionation and purification steps such as protein gel-electrophoresis and 2DLC at the peptide level allows for more in-depth coverage of the (phospho) proteome. What makes this approach even more attractive, is that the iTRAQ multiplexing allows for a replicate measurement within one experiment, creating a new data analysis workflow that meets the stringent requirements of peptide quantitation. All three instrument panels were able to annotate a large set of known phosphoproteins. Extending the latter sample fractionation and using novel methodologies to avoid dilution of reporter ratios in MSMS will allow for the annotation of increasing numbers of phosphopeptide with increasingly low stoichometries in the future.","publicationDate":"2015-01-30","submissionType":"COMPLETE","numAssays":6,"species":["Homo sapiens (Human)"],"tissues":["cell culture"],"ptmNames":["succinylated residue","deaminated residue","dehydrated residue","iTRAQ4plex-116 reporter+balance reagent acylated residue","monohydroxylated residue","deamidated residue","S-carboxamidoethyl-L-cysteine","carbamoylated residue","acetylated residue","methylthiolated residue"],"instrumentNames":["TripleTOF 5600","Synapt MS","Q Exactive"],"projectTags":["Biomedical"],"doi":"10.6019/PXD001574","submitter":{"title":"Dr","firstName":"Maarten","lastName":"Dhaenens","email":"maarten.dhaenens@ugent.be","affiliation":"Faculity of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology"},"labHeads":[{"title":"Dr","firstName":"Dieter","lastName":"Deforce","email":"dieter.deforce@ugent.be","affiliation":"Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Ghent University, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium"}],"submissionDate":"2014-12-05","reanalysis":null,"experimentTypes":["Shotgun proteomics"],"quantificationMethods":["iTRAQ"],"keywords":"iTRAQ, phosphoproteomics, PiTRAQ","sampleProcessingProtocol":"Phospho-iTRAQ protocol: a peptide sample is briefly split in two identical parts and differentially labeled preceding the phosphatase treatment of one part. Afterwards, samples are immediately recombined and split into three parts for the LC-MS/MS analysis on three different instruments (SynaptG2 Si, TripleTOF 5600 and QExactive). Data Analysis: Raw data was processed by the respective vendor’s software before it was made available to the authors (in the context of a demo) and MGF-files were searched against the SwissProt Human database using Mascot. Exported DAT-files were imported into Rover for ranking the iTRAQ ratios and further analyzed in Excel. Data: Initially phosphorylated peptides have skewed iTRAQ ratios and arise out of the center of the log-normal distribution of the whole precursor population. The mean of the log-normal ratio distribution is located around zero as the vast majority of the peptides in the data has equal 114/115 or 116/117 reporters.  Experimental workflow: In the “in-solution” approach, the  soluble protein extracts (R1) of control and EGF-stimulated HeLa cells was spiked with an internal peptide standard (IS2) of heavy phosphopeptides and compared by Phospho-iTRAQ. When only one sample is mined (EGF), the flexibility of the protocol allows for gel purification and fractionation and thus for complementing the soluble protein extract (R1) with the hydrophobic fraction diluted in strongly denaturing buffer (R3) to increase the number of annotated phosphopeptides (“in-gel” approach). The EGF-stimulated cells were here spiked with a phosphoprotein internal standard (IS1) before fractionation on a 1D PAGE into four molecular weight fractions followed by Phospho-iTRAQ. Next, the labeled peptides 114-116 and 115-117 were combined into two separate vials. To the 115-117 sample dephosphorylating enzyme cocktail and to the 114-116 sample only the buffers were added for simultaneous incubation. After the inhibition of the phosphatases, all parts were pooled.","dataProcessingProtocol":"Data acquisition, recording and pre-processing was carried out with software of the respective mass spectrometer manufacturers. Equally, the raw data was processed by specialized software packages of the vendors: ProteinPilot™ 4.0.8085 for the TripleTof 5600 of ABSciex, Proteome Discoverer 1.4 for the Thermo Scientific QExactive, and PLGS 3.0.1 for the SYNAPT G2-Si of Waters Cooperation. The same software packages were used to export the created peak lists in the MGF format. The database searches of these MGF files were performed with Mascot 2.4.0. (Matrix Science) against the SwissProt Human database (59.084 sequences, supplemented with the sequences of the internal standards). Initially, the prevalence of the most common modifications was explored by an Error Tolerant database search (25). Details an search parameters can be found in Supporting Information 3. The  result files of these searches were exported as Mascot-DAT file formats (Peptide e-value < 0.05), and each run was then imported separately in the Rover software for individual processing (https://code.google.com/p/compomics-rover/) (26). After obtaining Rover statistics on the 114/115 and 116/117 ratios, the data were filtered in order to export the log2 ratios and z-scores of unique or “razor” peptides for consecutive data validation. Data validation and frequency plot distribution of Z-scores (at a bin size of  0.1) was done in Excel, whereby the Z-scores of the four molecular weight fractions of the “R1+R3 extracts” were combined. Additional database searches were performed by changing the variable modifications in order to annotate the “heavy” internal standard phosphopeptides (see Supporting information 3). Phosphoprotein enrichment in the obtained protein lists was assessed by a right-sided Fisher enrichment test at a significance level of 5%. Known phosphoproteins in human were obtained from the PhosphoSitePlus database (www.phosphosite.com). The total number of proteins known in human was estimated based on the described proteins in the PFAM database. Proteins involved in the EGF pathway were identified by querying the BioCarta database.  To assess the relative amount of phosphopeptides present in the lists generated by the Phospho-iTRAQ approach, these lists were compared to the known phosphopeptides present in the PhosphoSitePlus database by means of a protein blast as integrated in the NCBI blast 2.2.28 package. The procedure allowed for partial mappings between Phospho-iTRAQ peptides and the phosphopeptides. That is, stretches of at least 5 amino acids in both peptide sequences had to map unambiguously to each other (irrespective of overhangs that result from e.g. tryptic miscleavages), i.e. no gaps or mutations were allowed in the procedure.  To assess a threshold for filtering out phosphopeptides, we first extracted the Z-scores of all annotated peptides that cannot be phosphorylated: peptides with no serine, threonine or tyrosine (No STY). On the No STY distribution, Z-scores at different quantile levels (1 to 25% on the left site of the distribution), were chosen as a cutoff value (Figure 3, upper panels). To select the phosphopeptides in the data, these Z-score cutoffs were subsequently transposed to the ranked Z-scores of the peptides that have the ability to be phosphorylated (with an STY in the sequence). Different levels, going from the left percentile to the quantiles of the distribution were applied to set the threshold on the 114/115-control sample and the 116/117-EGF treated sample.","otherOmicsLink":null,"numProteins":33327,"numPeptides":266318,"numSpectra":431988,"numUniquePeptides":78316,"numIdentifiedSpectra":85312,"references":[{"desc":"Glibert P, Meert P, Van Steendam K, Van Nieuwerburgh F, De Coninck D, Martens L, Dhaenens M, Deforce D.

Adult mosquitoes were maintained on a 10% sucrose solution.   Dissection of salivary glands  Anopheles stephensi salivary glands were dissected on slide using fine needles under a stereomicroscope at 4X magnification using phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and were pooled. After dissection the tissue were immediately placed in a PBS buffer (100 µl) with protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Diagnostics, Germany) and stored at -80 °C until use.  Salivary glands extract preparation  A total of 100 pairs of salivary glands of female An. stephensi were used to prepare salivary gland extract (SGEs). Dissected salivary glands (100 pairs) in PBS were sonicated on ice consists of three pulses for 20 sec. Afterward the suspension was centrifuged for 10 min at 5000 rpm at 4°C to remove cell debris.

Briefly, the excised gel slices were subjected to reduction and were dried in a vacuum centrifuge. DTT (10 mM) in ammonium bicarbonate (100 mM) was added to gel pieces and proteins were reduced for 1 hour at 56 0C. After cooling  to room temperature reduced proteins were alkylated with IAA (55 mM) in ammonium bicarbonate (100 mM) for 45 min at 25 0C. After incubation in the dark with occasional vortexing the gel pieces were washed with 50-100 μl of ammonium bicarbonate (100 mM) for 10 min, dehydrated by addition of acetonitrile, swelled by rehydration in ammonium bicarbonate (100 mM) and shrunk again by addition of the same volume of acetonitrile. After removal of the liquid phase, the gel pieces were completely dried in a vacuum centrifuge. Gel slices were then swollen in a digestion buffer containing ammonium bicarbonate (50 mM), CaCl2 (5 mM) and trypsin solution (12.5 ng/μl) (ratio 1:100) in an ice cold bath.

We defined a set of high-confidence Pom1 targets that were enriched for cytoskeletal and cell growth functions. Cdr2 was the only cell cycle target of Pom1 kinase activity that we identified in cells. Mutation of Pom1-dependent phosphorylation sites in the C-terminus of Cdr2 inhibited mitotic entry but did not impair Cdr2 localization. In addition, we found that Pom1 phosphorylated multiple substrates that function in polarized cell growth, including Tea4, Mod5, Pal1, the Rho GAP Rga7, and the Arf GEF Syt22. Purified Pom1 phosphorylated these cell polarity targets in vitro, confirming that they are direct substrates of Pom1 kinase activity and likely contribute to regulation of polarized growth by Pom1.

Twenty-five mg of TiO2 beads were added, and yeast peptides were vortexed by affixing to the top of a vortex mixer on the highest speed setting at room temperature for 1 h. Afterwards, the beads were washed twice with binding solution and three times with 100 μl 50% ACN / 0.1% TFA. Peptides were eluted twice with 50 mM KH2PO4 (adjusted to pH 10 with ammonium hydroxide). Peptide elutions were combined, quenched with 50% ACN / 5% formic acid, dried and desalted on a µHLB OASIS C18 desalting plate (Waters). Enriched phosphopeptides were subjected to a second round of phosphopeptide purification to increase phosphopeptide selectivity. In the second round, peptides were resuspended in 1500 µl of binding solution. Twenty mg of TiO2 beads were added, and phosphopeptide enrichment was carried out as in the first round. Peptide elutions were combined, quenched with 50% ACN / 5% formic acid, dried and desalted on a µHLB OASIS C18 desalting plate (Waters).Phosphopeptides were resuspended in SCX buffer A (7 mM KH2PO4, pH 2.65 / 30% ACN) and separated per injection on a 2.1 mm ID x 200 mm long SCX column (Phenomenex Luna SCX) as previously described (23), using a gradient of 0 to 10 % SCX buffer B (350 mM KCl / 7 mM KH2PO4, pH 2.65 / 30% ACN) over 10 minutes, 10% to 17% SCX buffer B over 17 minutes, 17% to 32% SCX buffer B over 13 minutes, 32% to 60% SCX buffer B over 10 minutes, 60% to 100% SCX buffer B over 2 minutes, holding at 100% SCX buffer B for 5 minutes, from 100% to 0% SCX buffer B over 2 minutes, and equilibration at 0% SCX buffer B for 65 minutes, all at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min, after a full blank injection of the same program was run to equilibrate the column. 24 fractions were collected from the onset of the void volume (1.5 minutes) until the elution of strongly basic peptides in the 100% SCX buffer B wash (37.5 minutes), at 1.5-minute intervals. After separation, the SCX fractions were dried and desalted using a µHLB OASIS C18 96-well desalting plate and manifold (Waters).","dataProcessingProtocol":"LC-MS/MS analysis for SILAC yeast phosphopeptides and in vitro kinase assays was performed on a LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) equipped with an Agilent 1100 capillary HPLC, FAMOS autosampler (LC Packings, San Francisco, CA) and nanospray source (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Dongnong 250 were used in this study. The seeds were sown into plastic basins (10 cm × 15 cm) and kept at room temperature. The plants were grown at 27 + 1°C with a 14:10 hour (light:dark) photoperiod with 80% relative humidity. When the maize plants developed to the interior leaf period, they were treated with 225 µM of MeJA for 12 hours. One batch of leaves were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C for protein extraction. Three batches of biological replicates were collected for both control and treated samples.  After MeJA treatment, corn leaves were grounded into powder in liquid nitrogen. The protein was precipitated in a 10% TCA, cold acetone solution (w/v) containing 0.07% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol at -20°C for two hours. After centrifugation at 40,000 ×g at 4°C for one hour, the supernatant was discarded and the pellet was rinsed with -20°C cold acetone containing 0.07% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol.

{"accession":"PXD001844","title":"Analysis of the Candida albicans phosphoproteome","projectDescription":"Candida albicans is an important human fungal pathogen in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals. In response to environmental stimuli, C. albicans regulates complex phenotypic transitions between morphological states, mating competence, and biofilm formation. In addition, other processes related to virulence, stress resistance, and cell wall structure are also highly regulated. Based on the phenotypes of mutants lacking different kinases, it is clear that protein phosphorylation plays an important role in the regulation of these pathways. Here, we present a qualitative analysis of the phosphoproteome of C. albicans hyphae. We identified 19,590 unique peptides that corresponded to 15,906 unique phosphosites on 2,896 proteins. The ratios of serine, threonine and tyrosine phosphosites were 80.01%, 18.11%, and 1.81%, respectively. The majority of proteins (2,111) contained at least two detected phosphorylation sites. Consistent with findings in other fungi, cytoskeletal proteins were among the most highly phosphorylated proteins, and there were differences in GO terms for proteins with serine and threonine versus tyrosine phosphorylation sites. This large-scale analysis identified phosphosites in protein components of Mediator, an important transcriptional co-regulatory protein complex. In vitro studies revealed Cdk8 (Ssn3), a kinase within the Mediator complex, was sufficient to catalyze a subset of these phosphorylations suggesting the potential for autoregulation. These data represent the deepest single analysis of a fungal phosphoproteome, and will lay the groundwork for future analyses of the C. albicans phosphoproteome and specific phosphoproteins.","publicationDate":"2015-03-25","submissionType":"COMPLETE","numAssays":13,"species":["Candida albicans (Yeast)"],"tissues":[],"ptmNames":["Dimethyl","Carbamidomethyl","Phospho","Dimethyl:2H(6)13C(2)","Oxidation"],"instrumentNames":["Orbitrap Fusion","Q Exactive"],"projectTags":["Biological"],"doi":"10.6019/PXD001844","submitter":{"title":"Dr","firstName":"Arminja","lastName":"Kettenbach","email":"arminja@dartmouth.edu","affiliation":"Dartmouth Med School"},"labHeads":[{"title":"Dr","firstName":"Arminja","lastName":"Kettenbach","email":"arminja@dartmouth.edu","affiliation":"Department of Biochemistry Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth"}],"submissionDate":"2015-02-25","reanalysis":null,"experimentTypes":["Shotgun proteomics"],"quantificationMethods":[],"keywords":"Candida albicans, phosphoproteome","sampleProcessingProtocol":"Preparation of C. albicans lysates A single colony of C. albicans strain SC5314 (34) was grown overnight in 50 mL YPD medium.

The cells were collected by centrifugation in 250 mL centrifugation cups for 5 min at 6,000 rpm. Cell pellets were washed once in 20 mL of phosphate buffered saline, then pelleted in 50 mL Falcon tubes (5,000 rpm for 10 min). The cell pellets were frozen at -80°C for at least 1 hour. The frozen cell pellets were lyophilized overnight in a freeze dryer (Labconco) and dry weights were measured. The dried cell mass was ground to a fine powder using mortar and pestle in the presence of liquid nitrogen. The ground cells were transferred to fresh 50 mL Falcon tubes and stored at -80°C. Enrichment and analysis of C. albicans phosphopeptides and mass spectrometric analysis  Lyophilized C. albicans powder was homogenized in ice cold lysis buffer containing 8 M urea, 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.1, 150 mM NaCl, phosphatase inhibitors (2.5 mM beta-glycerophosphate, 1 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM sodium molybdate, 1 mM sodium tartrate) and protease inhibitors (1 mini-Complete EDTA-free tablet per 10 ml lysis buffer; Roche Life Sciences) by means of sonication. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation, reduced, alkylated, and trypsin digested (35). After overnight digestion with trypsin at 37°C, the digest was acidified with TFA, peptides were desalted, and lyophilized (36). Two rounds of phosphopeptide enrichment using titanium dioxide microspheres were performed and phosphopeptides were separated by strong cation exchange chromatography (SCX) (36). After separation, the SCX fractions were dried, desalted, combined and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. LC-MS/MS analysis was performed on a Q-Exactive Plus mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) equipped with an Easy-nLC 1000 (Thermo Scientific).

Peptide motif analysis was performed based on (40).","dataProcessingProtocol":"GO term analysis The Gene Ontology Slim annotation was used for GO term analysis.  The gene association file, created 12/15/2014, was downloaded from the CGD website (www.candidagenome.org) and only annotations assigned to C. albicans (taxon: 5476) were used. In total 6,314 unique genes had at least one associated GO term and served as the background distribution of observed Gene Ontologies for the C. albicans genome in our study. GO enrichment analysis of the total phosphorylation (P-all), phospho-S/T (P-S/T) and phopho-Y (P-Y) were evaluated independently using the gene ontologies biological process, cellular component and molecular function. GO::TermFinder (41) as implemented via The Generic GO Term Finder (http://go.princeton.edu/cgi-bin/GOTermFinder) was used to test for ontology enrichment among phosphorylated peptides. To determine significance of enrichment of terms a Bonferroni corrected P-value cutoff of 0.05 was used. GO::TermFinder calculates a P-value using the hypergeometric distribution comparing the number of terms found in a set (phosphorylated genes) to the overall background of the genome (41). No evidence codes were excluded from the analysis.  The CGD Gene Ontology Slim Mapper available from the CGD website and an R script (GOstats.R, bioconductor) in which a GSEAGOHyperGParams function is used for calculating a P-value were also used to determine significant GO term enrichment and similar term enrichments were found. Heat maps of the categories were generated by calculating non-parametric ranking of percent values for each GO term using the “heatmap.2” function in the “gplots” package (42) in R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Strain construction and Mediator complex purification Wild type C.albicans Mediator complex was purified from cTTR03 through 6XHis-3XFlag tagged Med8 (43).To allow for the affinity purification of Mediator complex from mutant strains, one or both copies of MED8 were C-terminal tagged with 6XHis-3XFLAG (44) in AZC52 (med12Δ/Δ(43)), AZC63(med9Δ/Δ(43)), cTTR01 (med15Δ/Δ(43)) and SN913 (ssn3Δ/Δ(45)) as described previously (44) or by PCR products amplified by primer pairs LM025/LM014 (44) from the plasmids pFA6a-6XHis-3XFlag-HIS1 and pFA6a-6XHis-3XFlag-ARG4. These two template plasmids were generated by replacing the SAT1 marker on pFA6a-6XHis-3XFlag-SAT1 (44) between the AscI and PmeI sites with HIS1 and ARG4 marker subcloned from pFA6a-TAP-HIS1 and pFA6a-TAP-ARG4 (46) respectively. Similarly, both copies of SSN3 and SSN8 were 6XHis-3XFLAG tagged in BWP17 (47) by using primer pairs SSN3tag_sense/SSN3tag_anti and SSN8tag_sense/SSN8tag_anti (48) to generate yLM256 and yLM255 respectively. Each species of Mediator complex, containing the core subunits, used in this study was isolated from the high salt elution fraction of the Heparin column by FLAG affinity purification through the 6XHis-3XFlag tag placed on the C-terminus of Med8 or Ssn3 subunit as previously described (44). Free CDK8 module, containing only Ssn3/Cdk8, Ssn8/CycC, Ssn5/Med12 and Ssn2/Med13, was purified from the Heparin flow-through fraction of yLM255 lysate by FLAG purification. The Flag purification method was identical to above except that the salt concentration of the Heparin flow-through was adjusted from 150mM KOAc to 300mM KOAc before application to the Flag-agarose.

In this species, central compartment chloroplasts (C) and peripheral chloroplasts (P) collaborate with cytosolic and mitochondrial components in a NAD-ME type C4 cycle. How the two functionally different chloroplast types can develop within individual cells and the mechanism of import of nuclear encoded, plastid targeted proteins are currently unknown. We used 454 sequencing in combination with large scale label-free proteomics to determine the distribution of photosynthesis-related proteins. Subcellular localization of 169 protein was determined through comparison of protein abundance in four different subcellular fractions. 39 out of the 120 chloroplastic proteins showed differential accumulation between the two chloroplast types. Rubisco, RPP regenerative phase and PSII related proteins accumulated in C chloroplasts whereas C4 related proteins and the NDH complex were more abundant in P chloroplasts. Comparison of transit peptides of differential accumulating proteins indicated no obvious sequence homology or similarities in physico-chemical properties between members of the same group. Protein composition analysis of the central compartment indicated that mitochondria and peroxisomes are the only major components besides chloroplasts in this compartment. The combined information from subcellular and developmental protein profiling was used to generate a first draft of the protein machinery involved in single-cell C4 photosynthesis.","publicationDate":"2015-03-17","submissionType":"COMPLETE","numAssays":154,"species":["Bienertia sinuspersici","Arabidopsis thaliana (Mouse-ear cress)"],"tissues":["leaf"],"ptmNames":["iodoacetamide derivatized residue","monohydroxylated residue"],"instrumentNames":["LTQ Orbitrap"],"projectTags":["Biological"],"doi":"10.6019/PXD001910","submitter":{"title":"Dr","firstName":"Giulia","lastName":"Friso","email":"gf32@cornell.edu","affiliation":"Plant Biology"},"labHeads":[{"title":"Dr","firstName":"Giulia Friso c/o Klaas van Wijk's","lastName":"Lab","email":"gf32@cornell.edu","affiliation":"Cornell University"}],"submissionDate":"2015-03-12","reanalysis":null,"experimentTypes":["Shotgun proteomics"],"quantificationMethods":["Normalized Spectral Abundance Factor - NSAF"],"keywords":"Bienertia sinuspersici, shotgun proteomics,single-cell C4 Photosynthesis, subcellular organization","sampleProcessingProtocol":"For the developmental samples, 20 leaves of each developmental stage (youngest 0.3-1 mm in size, young 1-3 mm in size and mature approx. 2 cm in size) were harvested for each replicate from mature Bienertia plants. The frozen plant material was resuspended in extraction buffer (2% (w/v) SDS, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and 0.715 M 2-mercaptoethanol) and immediately boiled for 5 min. 50 µg of total protein extract from the 4 different localization samples and three different developmental samples were separated on Novex Tricine 10-20% PAA gels (Invitrogen) in two independent biological replicates. Individual gel lanes were cut into 10 (localization series) or 8 (developmental series) slices and proteins were digested with trypsin. Extracted peptides were analyzed by nano LC-LTQ-Orbitrap MS using data-dependent acquisition and dynamic exclusion.","dataProcessingProtocol":"Peak lists (.mgf format) were generated using DTA supercharge (version 1.19) software (http://msquant.sourceforge.net/) and searched with Mascot version 2.2 (Matrix Science) against the generated Bienertia databases. For off-line calibration, first a preliminary search was conducted with the precursor tolerance window set at 30 ppm. Peptides with ion scores above 40 were chosen as benchmarks to determine the offset for each LC-MS/MS run. This offset was then applied to adjust precursor masses in the peak lists of the respective .mgf file for recalibration using a Perl script. The recalibrated peak lists were searched against the Bienertia_Prandom rand DB.  Each of the peak lists were searched using Mascot version 2.2 (maximum P of 0.01) for full tryptic peptides using a precursor ion tolerance window set at 6 ppm, variable Met oxidation, fixed Cys carbamidomethylation, 1 miss cleavage allowed, and for semi-tryptic peptides using a precursor ion tolerance window set at 3 ppm, variable Met oxidation, fixed Cys carbamidomethylation, Glutamine to pyro-glutamic acid (N-term Q) modification,1 miss cleavage allowed and a minimal mascot ion score threshold of 30. This yielded a peptide false discovery rate below 1%, with peptide false positive rate calculated as 2 (decoy_hits/total_hits). The false protein identification rate of protein identified with two or more peptides was zero. To reduce the false protein identification rate of proteins identified by one peptide, the Mascot search results were further filtered as follows: ion score threshold was increased to 40 for one peptide identification and mass accuracy on the precursor ion was required to be within 3 ppm. Precursor ion masses below 700 D were discarded. All filtered results were uploaded into PPDB (http:// ppdb.tc.cornell.edu/; Sun et al., 2009). Detailed information of all identified peptides and protein sequences are accessible through PPDB (http:// ppdb.tc.cornell.edu) by using the unigene identifiers from Supplemental Table 1 as query in the \"Gene Name & Annotations\" section.  Calculation of adjSPC, NadjSPC, relative abundance and protein ratios and grouping of proteins with a high percentage of shared matched spectra. For protein quantification, spectral counts (SPC) were adjusted for the number of unique peptides vs. shared peptides between similar proteins resulting in an adjusted spectral count (adjSPC) as described in detail in (Friso et al., 2010). Proteins that shared more than approximately 80% of their matched adjusted peptides with other proteins were grouped using a similarity matrix. Normalized adjusted spectral counts (NadjSPC) used for the calculation of C/P as well as CC/TP ratios were calculated from adjSPC through division by the sum of all adjSPC in the corresponding sample.   Quantitative comparison of spectral count data was performed using the beta-binomial test (Pham et al., 2010) in the statistical software package \"R\" (Team, 2013) with the script provided by the authors. Tests were performed on adjSPC values since the beta-binomial test naturally normalized for the total number of spectral counts in each sample. All derived p-values were further corrected for multiple hypothesis testing using a graphically sharpened method. Adjusted p-values (a.k.a. q-values) smaller than 0.1 were interpreted with indication for enrichment or were considered to be significantly enriched (<0.05). For comparison of transit peptide features, Student's t-test was performed either on the direct data or in the case of index data after transformation to the arcsine.","otherOmicsLink":null,"numProteins":61458,"numPeptides":397712,"numSpectra":1435582,"numUniquePeptides":107666,"numIdentifiedSpectra":258728,"references":[{"desc":"Offermann S, Friso G, Doroshenk KA, Sun Q, Sharpe RM, Okita TW, Wimmer D, Edwards GE, van Wijk KJ.
